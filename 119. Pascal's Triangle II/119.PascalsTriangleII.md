## 🚀 Commented Solution

```javascript []
/*
 * @param {number} rowIndex
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var getRow = function (rowIndex) {
  let output = [[1], [1, 1]]; // Base cases: The first two rows of Pascal's Triangle
  if (rowIndex === 0 || rowIndex === 1) return output[rowIndex]; // Special case: Return the first or second row immediately

  // Start generating rows from the 3rd row onward
  for (let i = 2; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
    // Start at row 2 (since rowIndex 0 and 1 are already in the output array)
    let rowItems = Array(i + 1); // Create an array for the new row with length i + 1
    rowItems[0] = 1; // First element of every row is always 1
    rowItems[i] = 1; // Last element of every row is always 1

    // For the middle elements, calculate based on the sum of the two values from the previous row
    for (let itemIndex = 1; itemIndex < i; itemIndex++) {
      let rowAbove = i - 1; // Reference the row directly above in the output array
      let valueAboveLeft = output[rowAbove][itemIndex - 1]; // Get the element from the left above
      let valueAboveRight = output[rowAbove][itemIndex]; // Get the element directly above
      rowItems[itemIndex] = valueAboveLeft + valueAboveRight; // Sum the two elements to get the current value
    }

    output.push(rowItems); // Append the newly created row to the output array
  }

  return output[rowIndex]; // Return the specific row requested by rowIndex
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

### Understanding Pascal’s Triangle

Pascal’s Triangle follows a simple rule:

- The first and last elements of each row are always `1`.
- Each middle element in a row is the sum of the two numbers directly above it from the previous row.

For example:

```
     [1]          Row 0
    [1, 1]        Row 1
   [1, 2, 1]      Row 2
  [1, 3, 3, 1]    Row 3
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]  Row 4
```

To compute any row, we just need the previous row, and we can calculate each element in the new row as: `new_row[i]=previous_row[i−1]+previous_row[i]`

### Approach:

1. Base Case:
   If the `rowIndex` is `0` or `1`, return the precomputed rows (`[1]` or `[1, 1]`).
2. Iterative Approach:
   For every row starting from row `2`:

   - Create an array of size `i + 1`.
   - Set the first and last element to `1`.
   - For the middle elements, calculate the sum of the two elements from the previous row.

3. Final Step:
   Once the row at `rowIndex` is generated, return that specific row.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s debug step by step with different `rowIndex` values:

### Input: `rowIndex = 0`

- Since `rowIndex` is `0`, the base case returns `[1]`.

### Input: `rowIndex = 1`

- Since `rowIndex` is `1`, the base case returns `[1, 1]`.

### Input: `rowIndex = 3`

1. Start with the base array `output = [[1], [1, 1]]`.
2. Begin generating row 2:

   - `rowItems = [1, undefined, 1]`.
   - Calculate middle element:
     - `rowItems[1] = output[1][0] + output[1][1] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Row 2 becomes: `[1, 2, 1]`.
   - Append this to `output`: `output = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]`.

3. Next, generate row 3:

   - `rowItems = [1, undefined, undefined, 1]`.
   - Calculate middle elements:
     - `rowItems[1] = output[2][0] + output[2][1] = 1 + 2 = 3`.
     - `rowItems[2] = output[2][1] + output[2][2] = 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Row 3 becomes: `[1, 3, 3, 1]`.
   - Append this to `output`: `output = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]`.

4. Return the desired row: `output[3] = [1, 3, 3, 1]`.

### Input: `rowIndex = 4`

1. Start with `output = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]`.
2. Generate row 4:

   - `rowItems = [1, undefined, undefined, undefined, 1]`.
   - Calculate middle elements:
     - `rowItems[1] = output[3][0] + output[3][1] = 1 + 3 = 4`.
     - `rowItems[2] = output[3][1] + output[3][2] = 3 + 3 = 6`.
     - `rowItems[3] = output[3][2] + output[3][3] = 3 + 1 = 4`.
   - Row 4 becomes: `[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]`.
   - Append this to `output`: `output = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]`.

3. Return the desired row: `output[4] = [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is O(n²), where `n` is `rowIndex`. This is because:
  - For each row from `2` to `n`, we compute all elements in the row.
  - For each row `i`, there are `i` elements.
  - So the total number of operations is approximately `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n`, which sums to O(n²).

### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is O(n²) because:
  - We store all rows up to `rowIndex` in the `output` array.
  - Each row takes up space proportional to its length, and the total space used by all rows is O(n²).

If we only needed the final row, we could reduce space complexity to O(n) by only keeping the current row being generated and discarding previous rows.
