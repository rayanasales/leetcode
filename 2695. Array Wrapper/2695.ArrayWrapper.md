## Solution

```javascript [] []
var ArrayWrapper = function (nums) {
  this.value = nums;
};

ArrayWrapper.prototype.valueOf = function () {
  return this.value.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
};

ArrayWrapper.prototype.toString = function () {
  return `[${this.value.toString()}]`;
};

/**
 * Usage example:
 * const obj1 = new ArrayWrapper([1,2]);
 * const obj2 = new ArrayWrapper([3,4]);
 * obj1 + obj2; // 10
 * String(obj1); // "[1,2]"
 * String(obj2); // "[3,4]"
 */
```

# Explanation

The code we are working with is an example of how to create a simple class-like structure in JavaScript using functions and prototypes. In JavaScript, before ES6, "classes" were typically constructed using functions and prototype methods. Here's a breakdown of each part of the code:

1. **Constructor Function**:

   - **Syntax**: In JavaScript, a constructor function is used to create an object. It is defined just like any other function but is used with the `new` keyword to create instances of an object.
   - **Purpose**: The constructor function in your code is named `ArrayWrapper`. It takes an array of numbers as an argument and initializes the newly created object with this array.
   - **Code**:
     ```javascript []
     var ArrayWrapper = function (nums) {
       this.value = nums; // stores the array in a property of the object
       console.log(nums); // logs the array to the console
     };
     ```

2. **Prototype Methods**:

   - **Syntax**: Methods added to the prototype of a constructor function are shared among all instances of the constructor, rather than having their own separate copies. This is memory efficient.
   - **Purpose**: Prototype methods provide functionality to the instances of your constructor function.
   - **valueOf Method**:
     - This method overrides the default `valueOf` method which is called when JavaScript expects a number. In this case, it sums up the elements of the array.
     - **Code**:
       ```javascript []
       ArrayWrapper.prototype.valueOf = function () {
         return this.value.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0); // sums the array elements
       };
       ```
   - **toString Method**:
     - This method overrides the default `toString` method to provide a custom string representation of the object.
     - **Code**:
       ```javascript []
       ArrayWrapper.prototype.toString = function () {
         return `[${this.value.toString()}]`; // formats the array as a string
       };
       ```

3. **Creating Instances and Using Methods**:
   - **Syntax**: Instances of `ArrayWrapper` are created using the `new` keyword, which creates a new object, calls the constructor function with the provided arguments, and binds `this` to the new object.
   - **Code**:
     ```javascript []
     const obj1 = new ArrayWrapper([1, 2]);
     const obj2 = new ArrayWrapper([3, 4]);
     console.log(obj1 + obj2); // uses valueOf, output: 10
     console.log(String(obj1)); // uses toString, output: "[1,2]"
     console.log(String(obj2)); // uses toString, output: "[3,4]"
     ```

### Concepts

- **Classes in JavaScript**: A way to create objects that share properties and methods. Before ES6, this was achieved using constructor functions and prototypes as shown. From ES6 onwards, the `class` keyword can be used, providing a more familiar syntax for those coming from other object-oriented languages.
- **Constructor Function**: A function that initializes a newly created object.
- **Prototype**: An object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. Adding methods to a prototype ensures that all instances share these methods, rather than creating new functions for each instance.

This structure is a foundational concept in JavaScript and understanding it will help in grasping more complex patterns and frameworks. If you need further clarification on any of these points, feel free to ask!
