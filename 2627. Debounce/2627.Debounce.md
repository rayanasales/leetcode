## Background: everything you need to know

- `Debouncing`: Debouncing ensures that a function is only executed once after a specified delay. If the function is called again within that delay, the timer is reset.
- `setTimeout`: This function sets a timer that executes a function after a specified delay.
- `clearTimeout`: This function cancels a timer set with setTimeout.

By using these concepts, the debounce function helps to control how often a function can be executed, which can improve performance and prevent unnecessary operations.

## Solution in javascript

```js
var debounce = function (fn, t) {
  let timeout;

  return function (...args) {
    // If there is an existing timeout, it is cleared.
    // This ensures that the previous timer is cancelled if the function is called again within the debounce time.
    if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout);

    // A new timeout is set for the debounce time t.
    // When the timeout completes, the function fn is called with the arguments (args)
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      fn(...args);
    }, t);
  };
};
```

## Example Usage

```javascript
const log = debounce(console.log, 100);
log("Hello"); // This call will be cancelled by the next call
log("Hello"); // This call will be cancelled by the next call
log("Hello"); // This call will be executed after 100ms
```

In this example:

- The first call to `log('Hello')` sets a timer to execute `console.log` after 100ms.
- The second call to `log('Hello')` happens before the 100ms is up, so it cancels the previous timer and sets a new one.
- The third call to `log('Hello')` does the same, cancelling the previous timer and setting a new one.
- After 100ms from the third call, `console.log('Hello')` is executed.
