## Solution in javascript

```js
var lengthOfLastWord = function (s) {
  let sanitized = "";
  let previousChar = " ";

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    // If the current character is not a space, append it to 'sanitized'.
    if (s[i] !== " ") sanitized += s[i];
    // If the current character is a space and the previous character was not a space, append the space to 'sanitized'. This avoids multiple consecutive spaces.
    else if (s[i] === " " && previousChar !== " ") sanitized += s[i];
    previousChar = s[i]; // Update 'previousChar' with the current character for the next iteration.
  }
  let parts = sanitized.split(" ").filter((p) => p.length > 0); // Split 'sanitized' into an array of words, filtering out any empty strings.
  let partsLength = parts.length; // Calculate the number of parts (words) in the array.
  return parts[partsLength - 1].length; // Calculate the number of parts (words) in the array.
};
```

### Strategy Explanation

In solving the problem of finding the length of the last word in a string, I employed a strategy focused on pre-processing the input string and then efficiently finding the result. Here’s how I approached the problem:

1. **Sanitization Process**: Initially, I created a sanitized version of the input string 's' to ensure that consecutive spaces are reduced to a single space. This step is crucial as it simplifies the subsequent operations by standardizing the space between words.
2. **Tracking Characters**: To manage the sanitization accurately, I kept track of each character and its predecessor using a loop. This allowed me to conditionally add spaces between words only when they are followed by non-space characters. This avoids the creation of multiple spaces that could complicate the word count.
3. **Word Separation**: After constructing the sanitized string, I split it into an array of words. The split operation is based on spaces, and I used a filter to remove any empty entries that might still exist, ensuring that only valid words are considered.
4. **Finding the Last Word**: Finally, the length of the last word is directly accessed from the array. By determining the size of the array, I can index directly to the last element and retrieve its length.
