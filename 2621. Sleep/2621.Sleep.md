## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
function sleep(millis) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(millis);
    }, millis);
  });
}

// Usage example
let t = Date.now();
sleep(100).then(() => {
  console.log(Date.now() - t); // Outputs approximately 100ms
});
```

## Explanation

- Promise Constructor: We create a new promise that will resolve after a specified amount of time. The promise constructor takes a single argument: a callback function with `resolve` and `reject` parameters. Here, we only use `resolve` as we are not handling any errors.
- setTimeout Function: This function is used to delay the execution of its callback function by the number of milliseconds specified in `millis`. After the delay, it calls the `resolve` function, passing the `millis` value to indicate successful completion.
- Resolve Function: The resolve function inside the `setTimeout` callback ensures that the promise is fulfilled with the value `millis` once the timer completes. This design mimics a sleep function by using asynchronous JavaScript features to pause execution in a non-blocking manner.
