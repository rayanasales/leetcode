## 🚀 SOLUTION - NO BUILT IN LIBRARIES

```javascript []
class MyHashMap {
  constructor() {
    this.map = {};
  }
  put(key, value) {
    this.map[key] = value;
  }
  get(key) {
    if (this.map[key] || this.map[key] === 0) return this.map[key];
    else return -1;
  }
  remove(key) {
    delete this.map[key];
  }
}
```

## 🌎 Strategy Explained

The approach presented here simplifies the implementation of a HashMap by using JavaScript’s native object `{}` to store key-value pairs. This method leverages the native performance optimizations of JavaScript’s object to simulate the behavior of a HashMap.

### Key Components

1. Using Object as HashMap: JavaScript objects are ideal for key-value storage, as they provide efficient lookup, insert, and delete operations.
   - When you access `this.map[key]`, JavaScript internally performs the hashing and retrieves the value associated with the key. This reduces the need to manually handle bucket arrays, collisions, or custom hash functions.
2. Key Operations:
   - `put(key, value)`: Directly sets the key-value pair in the `map` object using `this.map[key] = value`.
   - `get(key)`: Checks if the key exists in the map. If it exists, return the value. If not, return `-1`. Special handling is done for values like `0` (which is a valid value but falsy in JavaScript).
   - `remove(key)`: Deletes the key-value pair from the map using `delete this.map[key]`.

### Why This Approach Works

- Simplicity: This solution avoids the complexity of manually implementing a hash function, handling collisions, or creating custom bucket arrays.
- Efficiency: By leveraging JavaScript’s built-in object implementation, we utilize the highly optimized internal workings of the JavaScript engine for `put`, `get`, and `remove` operations.

### Plan for Optimization

The code is already clean, efficient, and leverages the built-in optimizations of JavaScript objects. However, if you are operating in an environment with stricter memory or performance constraints, here are a few considerations:

- Handling Edge Cases for Large Datasets: Although objects perform well for most cases, for extremely large datasets (approaching the limits of `104` operations or beyond), switching to more advanced data structures like Maps may offer further performance tuning.
- Minimizing Memory Overhead: If keys are very large or complex objects, using a `Map` could offer more memory-efficient key handling.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s walk through the example step by step:

Input:

```javascript []
["MyHashMap", "put", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "remove", "get"][
  ([], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2])
];
```

1. Step 1: `MyHashMap()`

   - Initializes an empty map: `{}`.

2. Step 2: `put(1, 1)`

   - Adds key `1` with value `1`: The map becomes `{ 1: 1 }`.

3. Step 3: `put(2, 2)`

   - Adds key `2` with value `2`: The map becomes `{ 1: 1, 2: 2 }`.

4. Step 4: `get(1)`

   - Retrieves the value associated with key `1`: The map contains `{ 1: 1, 2: 2 }`.
   - The result is `1`.

5. Step 5: `get(3)`

   - Attempts to retrieve the value associated with key `3`. Since the key doesn't exist in the map, the result is `-1`.

6. Step 6: `put(2, 1)`

   - Updates the value for key `2` to `1`: The map becomes `{ 1: 1, 2: 1 }`.

7. Step 7: `get(2)`

   - Retrieves the value associated with key `2`: The map contains `{ 1: 1, 2: 1 }`.
   - The result is `1`.

8. Step 8: `remove(2)`

   - Removes the key `2`: The map becomes `{ 1: 1 }`.

9. Step 9: `get(2)`
   - Attempts to retrieve the value associated with key `2`. Since it was removed, the result is `-1`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- `put(key, value)`: Inserting into or updating a key in a JavaScript object is an O(1) operation on average.

- `get(key)`:Retrieving a key from a JavaScript object is also an O(1) operation on average.

- `remove(key)`: Deleting a key from a JavaScript object is an O(1) operation on average.

Thus, the time complexity for all operations (`put`, `get`, and `remove`) is O(1) on average.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of unique keys stored in the map. This is because we need to store each key-value pair in memory.
