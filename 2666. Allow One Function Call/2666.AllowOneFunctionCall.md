## Solution

```Javascript []
var once = function (fn) {
  let calls = 0;

  return function (...args) {
    if (calls === 0) {
      ++calls;
      return fn(...args);
    }
    return undefined;
  };
};

/**
 * Usage example
 * let fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c)
 * let onceFn = once(fn)
 *
 * onceFn(1,2,3); // 6
 * onceFn(2,3,6); // returns undefined without calling fn
 */
```

## Explanation

The function once is designed to allow a given function to be called only once. Subsequent calls to the returned function will not invoke the original function and will return undefined.

1. _Initialization_:
   A variable calls is initialized to keep track of the number of times the function has been called.

2. _Function Return_:
   The function returns a new function that takes any number of arguments (...args).

3. _Conditional Execution_:
   Inside the returned function, it checks if calls is 0. If it is, it increments calls and invokes the original function fn with the provided arguments.
   If calls is not 0, it simply returns undefined, ensuring that the original function fn is not called again.
