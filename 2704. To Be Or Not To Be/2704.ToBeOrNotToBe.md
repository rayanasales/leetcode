## Solution

```Javascript []
var expect = function (val) {
  function toBe(sencondVal) {
    if (val === sencondVal) return true;

    throw new Error("Not Equal");
  }
  function notToBe(sencondVal) {
    if (val !== sencondVal) return true;

    throw new Error("Equal");
  }

  return {
    toBe,
    notToBe,
  };
};

/**
 * Usage example:
 * expect(5).toBe(5); // true
 * expect(5).notToBe(5); // throws "Equal"
 */
```

## Explanation

The function expect is designed to create an object with two methods: toBe and notToBe. These methods are used to compare a given value with another value and throw errors if the comparison does not meet the expected condition.

1. Initialization:

   - The function takes a single argument val and returns an object with two methods: toBe and notToBe.

2. toBe Method:

   - The toBe method compares the initial value val with a second value sencondVal.
   - If the values are equal, it returns true.
   - If the values are not equal, it throws an error with the message "Not Equal".

3. notToBe Method:
   - The notToBe method compares the initial value val with a second value sencondVal.
   - If the values are not equal, it returns true.
   - If the values are equal, it throws an error with the message "Equal".
