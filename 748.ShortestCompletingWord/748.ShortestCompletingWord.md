## 💎 Strategy

In this problem, we aim to find the shortest completing word from a list of words. The word must contain all the letters from a given `licensePlate`, treating letters case-insensitively, and ignoring digits and spaces. If a letter appears more than once in the license plate, the word must contain at least that many occurrences of the letter.

### ⚡️ Plan for Optimization

The key to solving this problem efficiently lies in these strategies:

1. Sanitize the License Plate:  
   First, we remove all digits and spaces from the `licensePlate` and convert it to lowercase. This allows us to focus only on the letters that need to be matched.

2. Sort Words by Length:  
   Sorting the words by their length ensures that we check the shortest words first. This is crucial because we need to return the shortest completing word, and once we find a match, we can return immediately without checking longer words.

3. Match Characters by Replacing:  
   For each word, we progressively check if it can "complete" the license plate by replacing characters from the `licensePlate` copy. As soon as all characters are found and removed from the `licensePlate` copy, the current word is a valid solution.

4. Early Exit:  
   Once a valid completing word is found, the loop exits early, avoiding unnecessary checks and speeding up the solution.

This plan ensures both O(n) time complexity and minimal memory usage by keeping operations simple and efficient.

## 🚀 Commented Solution

```js
var shortestCompletingWord = (licensePlate, words) => {
  // Step 1: Sanitize the license plate by converting it to lowercase and removing digits and spaces
  let fixLicense = licensePlate.toLowerCase().replace(/[\d\s]/g, "");

  // Step 2: Sort the words by their length in ascending order, so we check the shortest words first
  let sortWords = [...words].sort((a, b) => a.length - b.length);

  // Step 3: Loop through the sorted words
  for (let word of sortWords) {
    // Copy the sanitized license plate (we will be removing matched characters from it)
    let copyLicense = fixLicense;

    // Step 4: Loop through each character of the current word
    for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
      // Try to remove the current word character from the copy of the license plate string
      copyLicense = copyLicense.replace(word[i], "");

      // Step 5: If the copy of the license plate is empty, it means all characters have been found
      if (!copyLicense) return word; // Return the word as the shortest completing word
    }
  }

  // Step 6: If no valid word is found (which shouldn't happen based on problem constraints), throw an error
  throw new Error("don`t have completing word");
};
```

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

### Test Case 1:

Input:

- `licensePlate = "1s3 PSt"`
- `words = ["step","steps","stripe","stepple"]`

Debugging:

- After sanitization: `fixLicense = "pst"`.
- Sort words by length: `["step", "steps", "stripe", "stepple"]`.
- Loop through each word:
  - `step`: Copy of `fixLicense = "pst"`.
    - Loop through `step`:
      - Replace `'s'` -> `copyLicense = "pt"`.
      - Replace `'t'` -> `copyLicense = "p"`.
      - Replace `'e'` -> No change.
      - Replace `'p'` -> `copyLicense = ""` (license plate is fully matched).
    - Return `"step"` as the shortest completing word.

Output: `"step"`

### Test Case 2:

Input:

- `licensePlate = "1s3 456"`
- `words = ["looks","pest","stew","show"]`

Debugging:

- After sanitization: `fixLicense = "s"`.
- Sort words by length: `["pest", "stew", "show", "looks"]`.
- Loop through each word:
  - `pest`: Copy of `fixLicense = "s"`.
    - Loop through `pest`:
      - Replace `'p'` -> No change.
      - Replace `'e'` -> No change.
      - Replace `'s'` -> `copyLicense = ""` (license plate is fully matched).
    - Return `"pest"` as the shortest completing word.

Output: `"pest"`

---

### Test Case 3:

Input:

- `licensePlate = "Ah71752"`
- `words = ["suggest","letter","of","husband","easy","education","drug","prevent","writer","old"]`

Debugging:

- After sanitization: `fixLicense = "ah"`.
- Sort words by length: `["of", "old", "drug", "easy", "letter", "writer", "husband", "prevent", "suggest", "education"]`.
- Loop through each word:
  - `of`: Copy of `fixLicense = "ah"`.
    - Loop through `of`: No matching letters.
    - `copyLicense` is not empty, continue to the next word.
  - `husband`: Copy of `fixLicense = "ah"`.
    - Loop through `husband`:
      - Replace `'h'` -> `copyLicense = "a"`.
      - Replace `'u'` -> No change.
      - Replace `'s'` -> No change.
      - Replace `'b'` -> No change.
      - Replace `'a'` -> `copyLicense = ""` (license plate is fully matched).
    - Return `"husband"` as the shortest completing word.

Output: `"husband"`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

1. Sanitizing the License Plate:  
   The license plate is processed in O(p), where `p` is the length of the `licensePlate`. We use a regular expression to remove digits and spaces and convert the string to lowercase.

2. Sorting the Words:  
   Sorting the `words` array by length takes O(w log w), where `w` is the number of words.

3. Processing Words:  
   For each word, we replace characters from the copy of the `licensePlate` in O(w \* l), where `w` is the number of words and `l` is the length of the longest word.

Thus, the total time complexity is O(w log w + w \* l).

### Space Complexity:

1. License Plate Sanitization:  
   The space required to store the sanitized `licensePlate` string is O(p).

2. Word Sorting:  
   We create a new sorted copy of the `words` array, which takes O(w) space.

3. Copy of License Plate:  
   For each word, we create a copy of the sanitized `licensePlate`, so the space complexity here is also O(p).

Thus, the overall space complexity is O(w + p).
