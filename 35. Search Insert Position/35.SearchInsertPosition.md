## Solution

```Java []
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        // Loop until the search space is exhausted
        while (left <= right) {
            int middle = (left + right) / 2; // Calculate the middle index

            if (nums[middle] == target) {
                return middle; // Target found, return its index
            } else if (nums[middle] < target) {
                left = middle + 1; // Move to the right half if target is greater
            } else {
                right = middle - 1; // Move to the left half if target is smaller
            }
        }

        // If target is not found, left will be the insertion point
        return left;
    }
}
```

```Javascript []
var searchInsert = function (nums, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    let middle = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (nums[middle] === target) {
      return middle; // If the target is found, return the index
    } else if (nums[middle] < target) {
      left = middle + 1; // If target is greater, search in the right half
    } else {
      right = middle - 1; // If target is smaller, search in the left half
    }
  }

  // If target is not found, left is the insertion point
  return left;
};
```

## Explanation

The function `searchInsert` is designed to find the position where the `target` should be inserted in a sorted array nums. It does this using a binary search, which ensures a runtime complexity of O(log n).

1. Initialization:

   - The function starts by setting two pointers: `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end. These pointers define the range of the array that we are searching through.

2. Binary Search:

   - In each iteration of the while loop, the function calculates the middle index (`middle = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)`).
   - It then checks if the element at `nums[middle]` is equal to the `target`. If so, it returns middle as the position of the `target`.
   - If `target` is greater than `nums[middle]`, the search continues in the `right` half by adjusting the `left` pointer (`left = middle + 1`).
   - If `target` is smaller than `nums[middle]`, the search continues in the `left` half by adjusting the `right` pointer (`right = middle - 1`).

3. Return the Insertion Point:
   - If the `target` is not found, the while loop ends when `left` surpasses `right`. At this point, the `left` pointer indicates the position where `target` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
