## Strategy

1. **Iterate over the array:** For each element in the array, try to insert it into a set.
2. **Check insertion success:** If the element is already in the set (i.e., the insertion fails), return `true` immediately because we found a duplicate.
3. **Return false if no duplicates:** If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return `false`.

This version optimizes both **runtime** and **memory** by avoiding additional operations and relying on the fast constant time operations provided by the `HashSet`.

## Solution

```javascript []
var containsDuplicate = function (nums) {
  let set = new Set(); // Create a Set to store unique elements

  // Loop through each element in the array
  for (let i of nums) {
    // If the element is already in the Set, it means we have found a duplicate
    if (set.has(i)) {
      return true; // Return true because a duplicate is found
    }
    // Otherwise, add the element to the Set to keep track of it
    set.add(i);
  }

  // If the loop completes and no duplicates are found, return false
  return false;
};
```

```java []
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(); // Create a set to store unique elements
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (!set.add(num)) { // If insertion fails, duplicate found
                return true;     // Return true if a duplicate is found
            }
        }
        return false; // If no duplicates are found, return false
    }
}
```

```python []
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        seen = set()  # Create a Set to store unique elements
        # Loop through each element in the list
        for num in nums:
            # If the element is already in the Set, it means we have found a duplicate
            if num in seen:
                return True  # Return True because a duplicate is found
            # Otherwise, add the element to the Set to keep track of it
            seen.add(num)
        # If the loop completes and no duplicates are found, return False
        return False
```

## Debug Demonstration for All Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**

   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]`
   - Steps:
     1. Try to add `1` to the set.
     2. Try to add `2` to the set.
     3. Try to add `3` to the set.
     4. Attempt to add `1` again. The element is already in the set → Return `true`.
   - Output: `true`

2. **Test Case 2:**

   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Steps:
     1. Try to add `1` to the set.
     2. Try to add `2` to the set.
     3. Try to add `3` to the set.
     4. Try to add `4` to the set.
     5. No duplicates found → Return `false`.
   - Output: `false`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `nums = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]`
   - Steps:
     1. Try to add `1` to the set.
     2. Attempt to add `1` again. The element is already in the set → Return `true`.
   - Output: `true`

### Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We iterate through the array once, and each set operation (insertion) takes O(1) on average.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), because we store each unique element in the set, and in the worst case, all elements are unique.
