## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var restoreString = function (s, indices) {
  let output = Array(s.length).fill("");
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    let current = s[i];
    let position = indices[i];
    output[position] = current;
  }
  return output.join("");
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

The strategy here revolves around efficiently rearranging the characters of the string `s` according to the `indices` array. Here’s how the approach works:

1. Initialize an Empty Array: Start by creating an empty array, `output`, with the same length as `s`, filled with empty strings. This array will represent the shuffled string.

2. Traverse the Input: Use a loop to iterate through every character in the string `s`. For each character:

   - Retrieve the current character from `s`.
   - Retrieve its corresponding target index from the `indices` array.
   - Place the character in the `output` array at the target index.

3. Join and Return the Result: Once all characters are placed in their respective positions, join the `output` array into a single string and return it.

This approach ensures that the character placement happens in one pass through the input arrays.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s debug the code step-by-step with example inputs.

### Example 1:

Input:  
`s = "codeleet"`  
`indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]`

Step-by-Step Execution:

1. Initialization:

   - `output = ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]` (an array of length 8 with empty strings).

2. Iterate through the string `s`:

   - `i = 0`: `current = "c"`, `position = 4`. Place `"c"` in `output[4]`.  
     `output = ["", "", "", "", "c", "", "", ""]`.
   - `i = 1`: `current = "o"`, `position = 5`. Place `"o"` in `output[5]`.  
     `output = ["", "", "", "", "c", "o", "", ""]`.
   - `i = 2`: `current = "d"`, `position = 6`. Place `"d"` in `output[6]`.  
     `output = ["", "", "", "", "c", "o", "d", ""]`.
   - `i = 3`: `current = "e"`, `position = 7`. Place `"e"` in `output[7]`.  
     `output = ["", "", "", "", "c", "o", "d", "e"]`.
   - `i = 4`: `current = "l"`, `position = 0`. Place `"l"` in `output[0]`.  
     `output = ["l", "", "", "", "c", "o", "d", "e"]`.
   - `i = 5`: `current = "e"`, `position = 2`. Place `"e"` in `output[2]`.  
     `output = ["l", "", "e", "", "c", "o", "d", "e"]`.
   - `i = 6`: `current = "e"`, `position = 1`. Place `"e"` in `output[1]`.  
     `output = ["l", "e", "e", "", "c", "o", "d", "e"]`.
   - `i = 7`: `current = "t"`, `position = 3`. Place `"t"` in `output[3]`.  
     `output = ["l", "e", "e", "t", "c", "o", "d", "e"]`.

3. Join the Result:
   - Join `output = ["l", "e", "e", "t", "c", "o", "d", "e"]` to form `"leetcode"`.

Output: `"leetcode"`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- The loop iterates over the length of `s` (`n` times).
- Array assignment and string concatenation (`join`) are efficient operations with linear complexity.
- Overall Time Complexity: O(n).

### Space Complexity:

- We use an extra array `output` of the same size as `s` to store the rearranged characters.
- The final string creation does not add significant space overhead.
- Overall Space Complexity: O(n).
