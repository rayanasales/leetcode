## Strategy

Given the constraints and the need to avoid loops or recursion, a mathematical approach is the most efficient. The key insight is that the largest power of three that fits within a 32-bit signed integer is `3^19 = 1162261467`. Any power of three that `n` can be must divide `1162261467` exactly.

## Solution

```Java []
// Solution in java (Runtime 0ms Beats 100.00%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        // The maximum power of three within the integer limit is 3^19 = 1162261467
        // If n is a power of three, it must divide 1162261467 without a remainder
        return n > 0 && 1162261467 % n == 0;
    }
}
```

```Javascript []
// Solution in javascript (Runtime 173ms Beats 24.38%)
var isPowerOfThree = function (n) {
  // The maximum power of three within the integer limit is 3^19 = 1162261467
  // If n is a power of three, it must divide 1162261467 without a remainder
  return n > 0 && 1162261467 % n === 0;
};
```

## Explanation of the Code

1. Understanding the Maximum Power of Three:
   - The largest power of three that can be represented within a 32-bit signed integer range is `3^19 = 1162261467`. This is because `3^20 = 3486784401`, which exceeds the `Integer.MAXVALUE` (`2^31 - 1`).
2. Condition `n > 0`:
   - We check if `n` is greater than `0` because a non-positive number cannot be a power of three.
3. Mathematical Check:
   - We use the property that if `n` is a power of three, it must divide `1162261467` exactly with no remainder (`1162261467 % n === 0` or `1162261467 % n == 0` in Java).
   - If this condition is true, then `n` is indeed a power of three; otherwise, it is not.
4. Return Value:
   - The function returns `true` if both conditions are met, meaning `n` is a power of three; otherwise, it returns `false`.
