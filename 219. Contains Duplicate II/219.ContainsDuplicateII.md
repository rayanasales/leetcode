## Strategy

1. **Use a HashMap:** Iterate over the array and use a HashMap (or HashSet) to store each element along with its index.
2. **Check for duplicates:** For each element, check if it already exists in the map and whether the index difference is within the allowed range `k`.
3. **Return true if a duplicate is found:** If we find such a pair of elements, return `true` immediately.
4. **Update the map:** Otherwise, update the element's index in the map to the most recent occurrence.

This version is optimized for **runtime** by ensuring we only scan through the array once and use constant-time lookup operations for the hash map.

## Solution

```javascript []
var containsNearbyDuplicate = function (nums, k) {
  let map = new Map(); // Create a HashMap to store elements and their indices

  // Iterate over the array
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // Check if the element already exists in the map and if the distance is <= k
    if (map.has(nums[i]) && i - map.get(nums[i]) <= k) {
      return true; // Found duplicate within range
    }
    // Update the map with the current index
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }

  return false; // No duplicates found within the allowed range
};
```

```java []
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // Create a HashMap to store elements and their indices

        // Iterate over the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Check if the element already exists in the map and if the distance is <= k
            if (map.containsKey(nums[i]) && i - map.get(nums[i]) <= k) {
                return true; // Found duplicate within range
            }
            // Update the map with the current index
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }

        return false; // No duplicates found within the allowed range
    }
}
```

```python []
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        seen = {}  # Create a HashMap to store elements and their indices

        # Iterate over the array
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # Check if the element already exists in the map and if the distance is <= k
            if num in seen and i - seen[num] <= k:
                return True  # Found duplicate within range
            # Update the map with the current index
            seen[num] = i

        return False  # No duplicates found within the allowed range
```

## Debug Demonstration for All Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**

   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1], k = 3`
   - Steps:
     1. Add `1` to the map at index `0`.
     2. Add `2` to the map at index `1`.
     3. Add `3` to the map at index `2`.
     4. `1` exists in the map at index `0`, and the difference is `3 - 0 = 3`, which is within `k = 3`. Return `true`.
   - Output: `true`

2. **Test Case 2:**

   - Input: `nums = [1, 0, 1, 1], k = 1`
   - Steps:
     1. Add `1` to the map at index `0`.
     2. Add `0` to the map at index `1`.
     3. `1` exists in the map at index `0`, and the difference is `2 - 0 = 2`, which is greater than `k = 1`. Continue.
     4. Add `1` to the map at index `2`.
     5. `1` exists in the map at index `2`, and the difference is `3 - 2 = 1`, which is within `k = 1`. Return `true`.
   - Output: `true`

3. **Test Case 3:**

   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], k = 2`
   - Steps:
     1. Add `1` to the map at index `0`.
     2. Add `2` to the map at index `1`.
     3. Add `3` to the map at index `2`.
     4. `1` exists in the map at index `0`, and the difference is `3 - 0 = 3`, which is greater than `k = 2`. Continue.
     5. Update the index of `1` in the map to `3`.
     6. `2` exists in the map at index `1`, and the difference is `4 - 1 = 3`, which is greater than `k = 2`. Continue.
     7. Update the index of `2` in the map to `4`.
     8. `3` exists in the map at index `2`, and the difference is `5 - 2 = 3`, which is greater than `k = 2`. Continue.
     9. Update the index of `3` in the map to `5`.
     10. No valid duplicates found within the allowed range. Return `false`.
   - Output: `false`

### Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once, and each HashMap operation (insert, lookup) takes O(1) on average.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), because we store the elements and their indices in the HashMap, and in the worst case, all elements are unique.
