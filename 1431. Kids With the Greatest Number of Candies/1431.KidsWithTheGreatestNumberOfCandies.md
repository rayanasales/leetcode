## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var kidsWithCandies = function (candies, extraCandies) {
  let result = [];
  let biggestNumber = Math.max(...candies);
  for (let i = 0; i < candies.length; i++)
    result.push(candies[i] + extraCandies >= biggestNumber);
  return result;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

The strategy of this solution is to determine whether each kid can have the greatest number of candies when given all the extra candies. To achieve this, the algorithm performs the following steps:

1. Identify the Maximum Candies: First, the function calculates the maximum number of candies any kid currently has. This is accomplished using the `Math.max` function applied to the entire `candies` array. This step ensures that you have a benchmark to compare against once you add the extra candies to each kid's count.

2. Evaluate Each Kid: Next, iterate through the `candies` array and for each element (representing each kid's candy count), add the `extraCandies` to the kid's current candy count.

3. Comparison and Result Array Construction: During the iteration, compare the new candy count (original candies of the kid + extraCandies) to the maximum candy count found in the first step. If the new count is greater than or equal to the maximum, append `true` to the `result` array; otherwise, append `false`.

4. Return Result: After evaluating all kids, return the `result` array which now contains a boolean for each kid, indicating whether they can have the greatest number of candies.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let's debug the provided examples one by one:

- Example 1: `candies = [2,3,5,1,3]`, `extraCandies = 3`

  - Maximum candies among kids = 5.
  - Iterate and calculate: [5, 6, 8, 4, 6]. All except the fourth kid can equal or surpass the maximum candies, hence the result is `[true, true, true, false, true]`.

- Example 2: `candies = [4,2,1,1,2]`, `extraCandies = 1`

  - Maximum candies among kids = 4.
  - Iterate and calculate: [5, 3, 2, 2, 3]. Only the first kid exceeds or meets the maximum, so the result is `[true, false, false, false, false]`.

- Example 3: `candies = [12,1,12]`, `extraCandies = 10`
  - Maximum candies among kids = 12.
  - Iterate and calculate: [22, 11, 22]. The first and third kids surpass the maximum, yielding `[true, false, true]`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n) - The function iterates through the `candies` array once, with the `Math.max()` function also operating in O(n) time. Hence, the overall time complexity is linear, relative to the number of kids (n).
- Space Complexity: O(n) - The space complexity is also O(n), as additional space is required for the `result` array which stores a boolean for each kid.

This concise and clear approach to determining if kids can have the greatest number of candies with the given extras is efficient in both time and space, making it an optimal solution for the problem.
