## 🌎 Strategy

The problem at hand is to determine whether you can provide the correct change to each customer at a lemonade stand, where each lemonade costs `$5`, and customers pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill. The key strategy is to keep track of the number of `$5` and `$10` bills since these are the denominations you'll need to provide change.

#### Plan for Optimization

- Maintain Counters for `$5` and `$10` Bills: As you process each transaction, update the count of these bills.
- Early Termination: If at any point you cannot provide the required change, exit early to save computation time.
- Avoid Complex Data Structures: Use simple integer counters to avoid the overhead of more complex data structures.

## 🚀 Commented Solution

```javascript []
var lemonadeChange = function (bills) {
  let fiveDollars = 0,
    tenDollars = 0; // Track `$5` and `$10` bills

  for (let i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
    let bill = bills[i];

    // Customer pays with a `$5` bill
    if (bill === 5) {
      fiveDollars++; // Increase `$5` bill counter
    }
    // Customer pays with a `$10` bill
    else if (bill === 10) {
      if (fiveDollars === 0) return false; // Can't give change if no `$5` bills
      fiveDollars--; // Give a `$5` bill as change
      tenDollars++; // Increase `$10` bill counter
    }
    // Customer pays with a `$20` bill
    else if (bill === 20) {
      // Prefer to give one `$10` and one `$5` as change if possible
      if (tenDollars > 0 && fiveDollars > 0) {
        tenDollars--;
        fiveDollars--;
      }
      // Otherwise, give three `$5` bills as change
      else if (fiveDollars >= 3) {
        fiveDollars -= 3;
      } else {
        return false; // Can't give change
      }
    }
  }
  return true; // Successfully provided change to all customers
};
```

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

```bash
1. First input: [5,5,5,10,20]

   - Start: `fiveDollars = 0, tenDollars = 0`
   - Bill = 5: `fiveDollars = 1`
   - Bill = 5: `fiveDollars = 2`
   - Bill = 5: `fiveDollars = 3`
   - Bill = 10: Use one `$5`, `fiveDollars = 2, tenDollars = 1`
   - Bill = 20: Use one `$10` and one `$5`, `fiveDollars = 1, tenDollars = 0`
   - Return true

2. Second input: [5,5,10,10,20]

   - Start: `fiveDollars = 0, tenDollars = 0`
   - Bill = 5: `fiveDollars = 1`
   - Bill = 5: `fiveDollars = 2`
   - Bill = 10: Use one `$5`, `fiveDollars = 1, tenDollars = 1`
   - Bill = 10: Use one `$5`, `fiveDollars = 0, tenDollars = 2`
   - Bill = 20: Cannot give correct change (need at least one `$5`)
   - Return false
```

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of transactions (length of the bills array). Each transaction is processed once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since the storage used does not depend on the size of the input but only stores a constant number of bill counters (two integers).

This approach efficiently manages the transactions with minimal overhead, ensuring that it performs well even for large input sizes.
