## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
const finalValueAfterOperations = (operations) => {
  let x = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    if (operations[i] === "X++" || operations[i] === "++X") x++;
    else x--;
  }
  return x;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

The problem requires us to adjust a variable `x` by incrementing or decrementing it based on a list of operations. Here’s the approach we used to make this solution fast and efficient:

1. Initialize `x` to 0 as the starting value.
2. Loop through each operation in the `operations` array:
   - If the operation is `"X++"` or `"++X"`, increment `x` by 1.
   - If the operation is `"X--"` or `"--X"`, decrement `x` by 1.
3. Return the final value of `x` after processing all operations.

This approach is efficient because it avoids unnecessary function calls and branching. By directly comparing the operation string and using simple conditionals, we minimize the runtime and ensure the solution is straightforward and easy to understand.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s go through each step with some example inputs:

### Example 1

Input: `operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]`

1. Initialize `x`: `x = 0`
2. First Operation: `"--X"`
   - Operation matches decrement condition (`--X`), so `x = x - 1 = -1`
3. Second Operation: `"X++"`
   - Operation matches increment condition (`X++`), so `x = x + 1 = 0`
4. Third Operation: `"X++"`
   - Operation matches increment condition (`X++`), so `x = x + 1 = 1`

Output: `1`

### Example 2

Input: `operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]`

1. Initialize `x`: `x = 0`
2. First Operation: `"++X"`
   - Operation matches increment condition (`++X`), so `x = x + 1 = 1`
3. Second Operation: `"++X"`
   - Operation matches increment condition (`++X`), so `x = x + 1 = 2`
4. Third Operation: `"X++"`
   - Operation matches increment condition (`X++`), so `x = x + 1 = 3`

Output: `3`

### Example 3

Input: `operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]`

1. Initialize `x`: `x = 0`
2. First Operation: `"X++"`
   - Operation matches increment condition (`X++`), so `x = x + 1 = 1`
3. Second Operation: `"++X"`
   - Operation matches increment condition (`++X`), so `x = x + 1 = 2`
4. Third Operation: `"--X"`
   - Operation matches decrement condition (`--X`), so `x = x - 1 = 1`
5. Fourth Operation: `"X--"`
   - Operation matches decrement condition (`X--`), so `x = x - 1 = 0`

Output: `0`

This breakdown helps ensure that each operation is processed as expected and provides a clear view of how `x` changes with each step.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of operations. We iterate through the `operations` array once, performing constant-time operations for each element. This guarantees an optimal runtime.

- Space Complexity: \(O(1)\), as we only use one variable, `x`, to store the final result, regardless of the input size.
