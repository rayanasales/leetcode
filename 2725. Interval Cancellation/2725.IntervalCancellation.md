## Understanding the Challenge

The task is to create a function that calls another function (`fn`) repeatedly every `t` milliseconds until it's told to stop. To add a twist, it must also be cancellable, meaning you can stop it on demand before it runs into infinity.

## Solution

```Javascript []
var cancellable = function (fn, args, t) {
  let intervalId; // This will hold the ID of the interval

  const cancelFn = () => {
    clearInterval(intervalId); // Stops the interval
  };

  fn(...args); // Call the function immediately with the provided arguments

  intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    fn(...args); // Repeats the function call every `t` milliseconds
  }, t);

  return cancelFn; // Returns the function that can stop the interval
};
```

## Breakdown of the Code

1. **Immediate Function Call:** Right off the bat, we call `fn` with the specified arguments. This ensures that `fn` runs at least once immediately when `cancellable` is called.

2. **Setting Up the Interval:** We use `setInterval` to schedule `fn` for repeated execution every `t` milliseconds. This is key to creating repetitive, non-blocking calls in JavaScript.

3. **Cancelling the Interval:** We provide a `cancelFn`, which is a small function that can stop the interval anytime by calling `clearInterval`. This gives you control over when to stop executing `fn`.

4. **Returning the Cancel Function:** Finally, the `cancellable` function returns `cancelFn`, allowing you to call it later to stop the interval whenever needed.
