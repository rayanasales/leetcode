## 🚀 Solution

```javascript []
var search = function (nums, target) {
  return nums.indexOf(target);
};
```

---

## 🔎 Explanation

- The `indexOf()` method returns the first index (position) of a specified value.
- The `indexOf()` method returns -1 if the value is not found.
- The `indexOf()` method starts at a specified index and searches from left to right (from the given start postion to the end of the array).
- By default the search starts at the first element and ends at the last.
- Negative start values counts from the last element (but still searches from left to right).
