## Javascript Solution

```js
var strStr = function (str1, str2) {
  if (!str1.includes(str2)) return -1;

  let str2FirstChar = str2[0]; // Store the first character of `str2` for comparison
  let str2Length = str2.length; // Store the length of `str2` to use when extracting substrings from `str1`

  for (let i = 0; i < str1.length; i++) {
    // Loop through `str1` to find a match for `str2`
    if (str1[i] === str2FirstChar) {
      // If the current character in `str1` matches the first character of `str2`...
      let temp = str1.slice(i, i + str2Length); // Extract the substring of length `str2Length` starting at index `i`
      if (temp === str2) return i; // If the extracted substring matches `str2`, return the current index `i`. Otherwise, keep searching.
    }
  }
  return -1;
};
```

### Strategy Explanation

Your function `strStr` is designed to find the first occurrence of the string `str2` (needle) within the string `str1` (haystack). Here's how it accomplishes this:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if `str2` is contained within `str1` using the `.includes()` method. If `str2` is not present, the function immediately returns `1`. This step helps to quickly handle cases where `str2` is absent from `str1`, thus avoiding unnecessary computations.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The function initializes two variables:
   - `str2FirstChar`: This stores the first character of `str2`. It's used to quickly identify potential start points in `str1` where `str2` might begin.
   - `str2Length`: This stores the length of `str2`, which is crucial for extracting substrings of the same length from `str1`.
3. **Loop Through `str1`**: The function then iterates through each character of `str1`. For each character that matches the `str2FirstChar`, it performs the following:
   - **Substring Extraction**: It extracts a substring from `str1` starting at the current index `i` and extending for `str2Length` characters.
   - **Substring Comparison**: It compares this substring with `str2`. If they match, it means that `str2` starts at index `i` in `str1`, and the function returns `i`.
4. **Completion**: If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `1`, indicating that `str2` was not found within `str1`.

This method is effective because it quickly eliminates cases where the needle is not present in the haystack and efficiently searches for the needle starting points only at potential matches, reducing the number of unnecessary comparisons.
