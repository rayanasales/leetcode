## 🌎 Strategy

1. Row Mapping: Precompute a map (`rowMap`) that links each character to its respective row (1 for row 1, 2 for row 2, and 3 for row 3).

2. Word Validation:

   - For each word, determine the row of the first letter. Then, check if every subsequent letter belongs to the same row using `rowMap`.
   - If any character is from a different row, skip the word early.

3. Minimized Operations: We minimize operations by leveraging direct lookup with `rowMap` and breaking early when characters don't match the row.
4. Space Efficiency: Only two extra variables (`output` and `rowMap`) are needed, ensuring minimal space usage.

## 🚀 Commented Solution

```javascript []
var findWords = function (words) {
  // Create a mapping of each letter to its row number
  const rowMap = {
    q: 1,
    w: 1,
    e: 1,
    r: 1,
    t: 1,
    y: 1,
    u: 1,
    i: 1,
    o: 1,
    p: 1,
    a: 2,
    s: 2,
    d: 2,
    f: 2,
    g: 2,
    h: 2,
    j: 2,
    k: 2,
    l: 2,
    z: 3,
    x: 3,
    c: 3,
    v: 3,
    b: 3,
    n: 3,
    m: 3,
  };

  const output = [];

  // Loop through each word
  for (let word of words) {
    let lowerWord = word.toLowerCase();
    let firstRow = rowMap[lowerWord[0]]; // Get the row of the first character

    let canBeTyped = true;

    // Check if all characters in the word belong to the same row
    for (let i = 1; i < lowerWord.length; i++) {
      if (rowMap[lowerWord[i]] !== firstRow) {
        canBeTyped = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    // If word can be typed using one row, add it to the output
    if (canBeTyped) {
      output.push(word);
    }
  }

  return output;
};
```

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

### [Test Case 1] Input: `["Hello", "Alaska", "Dad", "Peace"]`

1. "Hello":
   - Convert to lowercase → `"hello"`
   - First character 'h' belongs to row 2.
   - Next, 'e' belongs to row 1 → mismatch → skip "Hello".
2. "Alaska":
   - Convert to lowercase → `"alaska"`
   - First character 'a' belongs to row 2.
   - All subsequent characters belong to row 2 → add "Alaska" to the output.
3. "Dad":
   - Convert to lowercase → `"dad"`
   - First character 'd' belongs to row 2.
   - All subsequent characters also belong to row 2 → add "Dad" to the output.
4. "Peace":
   - Convert to lowercase → `"peace"`
   - First character 'p' belongs to row 1.
   - Next, 'a' belongs to row 2 → mismatch → skip "Peace".

#### Output: `["Alaska", "Dad"]`

---

### [Test Case 2] Input: `words = ["omk"]`

1. Processing the word "omk":
   - Convert to lowercase: `lowerWord = "omk"`.
   - The first character 'o' belongs to row 1.
   - Next, we check the second character 'm':
     - 'm' belongs to row 3 → mismatch → skip "omk" (because it has characters from different rows).

#### Output: `[]`

---

### [Test Case 3] Input: `words = ["adsdf", "sfd"]`

1. Processing the word "adsdf":

   - Convert to lowercase: `lowerWord = "adsdf"`.
   - The first character 'a' belongs to row 2.
   - Check the other characters:
     - 'd' belongs to row 2.
     - 's' belongs to row 2.
     - 'd' belongs to row 2.
     - 'f' belongs to row 2.
   - All characters belong to row 2 → add "adsdf" to the output.

2. Processing the word "sfd":
   - Convert to lowercase: `lowerWord = "sfd"`.
   - The first character 's' belongs to row 2.
   - Check the other characters:
     - 'f' belongs to row 2.
     - 'd' belongs to row 2.
   - All characters belong to row 2 → add "sfd" to the output.

#### Output: `["adsdf", "sfd"]`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(N \* M), where `N` is the number of words and `M` is the average length of each word. We only scan each word once, making it very efficient.
- Space complexity: O(1) for constant extra space with `rowMap` and a result array.
