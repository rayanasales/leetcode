## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var convertDateToBinary = function (date) {
  let [year, month, day] = date.split("-");
  let decToBin = (dec) => (dec >>> 0).toString(2);
  return `${decToBin(year)}-${decToBin(month)}-${decToBin(day)}`;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

The objective of this function is to convert a date in the "yyyy-mm-dd" format into its binary representation. Here’s a breakdown of the strategy used:

1. **Split the Date**: We start by splitting the input date string into its constituent parts: year, month, and day. This is achieved using the `split("-")` method, which divides the date at the hyphens and returns an array of the split strings.

2. **Binary Conversion Function**: A helper function `decToBin` is defined to take a decimal (base 10) number and convert it to binary (base 2). This function leverages JavaScript’s bitwise shift operator `>>>` with `0` to handle the conversion, ensuring the number is treated as an unsigned integer. The `toString(2)` method is then used to convert this integer into a binary string.

3. **Construct the Binary Date**: Using template literals, the binary representations of the year, month, and day are concatenated into the final string format "binary-year-binary-month-binary-day". Each component is separated by hyphens.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let's debug the function using the example input "2080-02-29":

1. **Input Splitting**: The date string "2080-02-29" is split into ["2080", "02", "29"].
2. **Binary Conversion**:
   - Year "2080" converts to binary "100000100000".
   - Month "02" converts to binary "10".
   - Day "29" converts to binary "11101".
3. **Concatenation**: The binary strings are combined to form the output "100000100000-10-11101".

**Another Debug Example with "1900-01-01":**

1. **Input Splitting**: The date string "1900-01-01" is split into ["1900", "01", "01"].
2. **Binary Conversion**:
   - Year "1900" converts to binary "11101101100".
   - Month "01" converts to binary "1".
   - Day "01" converts to binary "1".
3. **Concatenation**: The binary strings are combined to form the output "11101101100-1-1".

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1). The function involves a constant amount of work—splitting the date string, converting three numbers to their binary representations, and then combining these strings. The input size is fixed, thus ensuring the time complexity remains constant.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The space used by the function is also constant as it only stores a few variables regardless of the input, and the output string length is bounded by the fixed format of the input date.

This function is efficient and concise, managing to perform the required conversions and format assembly in minimal steps and using a straightforward approach.
