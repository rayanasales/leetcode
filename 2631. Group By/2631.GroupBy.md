## Solution in javascript

```javascript
Array.prototype.groupBy = function (fn) {
  let output = {};

  this.forEach((current) => {
    let key = fn(current);

    if (!output[key]) {
      output[key] = [];
    }

    output[key].push(current);
  });

  return output;
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialize the output as a plain object**:

   ```javascript
   let output = {};
   ```

   - Use a plain object to store the grouped results.

2. **Iterate over the array**:

   ```javascript
   this.forEach((current) => {
       let key = fn(current);
   ```

   - Use `forEach` to iterate over each element in the array and apply the provided function `fn` to get the key.

3. **Group items by the key**:

   ```javascript
   if (!output[key]) {
     output[key] = [];
   }

   output[key].push(current);
   ```

   - Check if the key already exists in the output object.
   - If not, initialize it as an empty array.
   - Push the current item into the array corresponding to the key.

4. **Return the grouped object**:
   ```javascript
   return output;
   ```
