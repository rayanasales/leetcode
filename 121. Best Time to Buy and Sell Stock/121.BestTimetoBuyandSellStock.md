## Solution

```javascript []
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let minPrice = Infinity; // Track the minimum price so far
  let maxProfit = 0; // Track the maximum profit

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
      minPrice = prices[i]; // Update minimum price if a lower price is found
    } else {
      // Calculate profit by selling on the current day and buying at minPrice
      let profit = prices[i] - minPrice;
      maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit); // Update maxProfit if current profit is higher
    }
  }

  return maxProfit;
};
```

## Debug entries

### Test Case: `prices = [2, 4, 1]`

1. **Day 1 (price = 2)**:

   - `minPrice` becomes 2.
   - Profit = 0, since we can't sell on the same day.

2. **Day 2 (price = 4)**:

   - Profit = 4 - 2 = 2.
   - `maxProfit` becomes 2.

3. **Day 3 (price = 1)**:
   - `minPrice` becomes 1 (we've found a new minimum).
   - Profit = 0 (selling today after buying at 1 isn't possible).
   - `maxProfit` remains 2.

So, the maximum profit is `2`, which is the correct answer.
