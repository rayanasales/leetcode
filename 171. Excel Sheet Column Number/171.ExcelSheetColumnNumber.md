## Javascript Solution with comments

```js
function titleToNumber(columnTitle) {
  let result = 0;

  // Loop through each character in the columnTitle string
  for (let i = 0; i < columnTitle.length; i++) {
    // Convert the character to its corresponding number
    // 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., 'Z' to 26
    // We achieve this by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from the current character
    // and then adding 1 to get the correct value.
    const d = columnTitle.charCodeAt(i) - "A".charCodeAt(0) + 1;

    // Accumulate the result by shifting the previous result by 26 (base-26) and adding the current value.
    result = result * 26 + d;
  }

  return result;
}
```

### Explanation of the Algorithm and Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires converting an Excel column title (like "A", "AB", "ZY") into its corresponding column number.
   - Excel columns are represented in a base-26 numeral system using uppercase letters ('A' to 'Z'), where 'A' is 1, 'B' is 2, ..., 'Z' is 26. Beyond 'Z', the titles continue with 'AA', 'AB', etc.
2. **Base-26 Conversion**:
   - Similar to how you might convert a number from one base to another, this problem involves converting a string representing a base-26 number into a decimal (base-10) number.
   - Each letter in the string contributes a value depending on its position in the string. For example, in "AB", 'A' contributes 1 \* 26 (because it's in the 26's place), and 'B' contributes 2 (because it's in the 1's place).
3. **Character Conversion**:
   - The key step in the algorithm is converting each character in the string to its corresponding numeric value. This is done by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from the character's ASCII value and adding 1. For instance, 'A' becomes 1, 'B' becomes 2, ..., 'Z' becomes 26.
   - `charCodeAt(i)` is used to get the ASCII value of the character at index `i`, and `'A'.charCodeAt(0)` gives us the ASCII value of 'A', which is then subtracted.
4. **Accumulate the Result**:
   - The algorithm starts with an initial result of 0. For each character in the column title, the current result is multiplied by 26 (to shift it left by one digit in base-26) and then the numeric value of the current character is added.
   - This accumulation process continues until all characters in the string are processed, giving us the final column number.
5. **Efficiency**:
   - The algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it processes each character exactly once.
   - The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a few extra variables regardless of the input size.
