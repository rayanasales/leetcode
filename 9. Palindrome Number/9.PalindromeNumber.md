## Solution

```Javascript []
function isPalindrome(x) {
  // Early return for negative numbers and numbers ending in 0 (except 0 itself)
  if (x < 0 || (x % 10 === 0 && x !== 0)) {
    return false;
  }

  let reversedHalf = 0;

  // Reverse the second half of the number
  while (x > reversedHalf) {
    reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + (x % 10);
    x = Math.floor(x / 10);
  }

  // Directly compare the two halves
  return x === reversedHalf || x === Math.floor(reversedHalf / 10);
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initial Check:**

   ```Javascript []
   if (x < 0 || (x % 10 === 0 && x !== 0)) {
     return false;
   }
   ```

   - **Checking for negative numbers**: Any negative number cannot be a palindrome because the negative sign `-` does not appear at the end of the number when it is read backward. For example, `-121` would be read as `121-`, which is clearly not a palindrome.
   - **Checking for numbers ending in 0**: Any number ending in `0` (except `0` itself) cannot be a palindrome because the number would start with `0` if read backward, which is not possible for integers.

2. **Initializing the `reversedHalf` variable:**

   ```Javascript []
   let reversedHalf = 0;
   ```

   - This variable is used to build the reversed half of the original number. For example, if the original number is `1221`, `reversedHalf` will become `12` by the end of the loop.

3. **Loop to reverse half of the number:**

   ```Javascript []
   while (x > reversedHalf) {
     reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + (x % 10);
     x = Math.floor(x / 10);
   }
   ```

   - **Loop condition `while (x > reversedHalf)`**: The loop continues until `x` is less than or equal to `reversedHalf`. This ensures that we are processing half of the number.
   - **Reversing half of the number**:
     - `(x % 10)` gets the last digit of `x`.
     - `reversedHalf = (reversedHalf * 10) + (x % 10)` adds this last digit to `reversedHalf`, effectively building the reversed version of half of the number.
     - `x = Math.floor(x / 10)` removes the last digit from `x` (i.e., divides `x` by 10 and discards the remainder).
   - **Practical Example**:
     - If `x = 1221`, in the first cycle:
       - `reversedHalf = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1`
       - `x = 1221 // 10 = 122`
     - In the second cycle:
       - `reversedHalf = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12`
       - `x = 122 // 10 = 12`
     - Now, `x` equals `reversedHalf`, so the loop stops.

4. **Final Comparison:**

   ```Javascript []
   return x === reversedHalf || x === Math.floor(reversedHalf / 10);
   ```

   - **x === reversedHalf**: For numbers with an even number of digits, this condition checks whether the first half of the number is equal to the reversed half.
     - Example: `1221` -> After the loop, `x = 12` and `reversedHalf = 12`, so `x === reversedHalf` is `true`.
   - **x === Math.floor(reversedHalf / 10)**: For numbers with an odd number of digits, this condition disregards the middle digit.
     - Example: `12321` -> After the loop, `x = 12` and `reversedHalf = 123`. Dividing `reversedHalf` by 10, we get `12`, so `x === Math.floor(reversedHalf / 10)` is `true`.

### Summary of Functioning:

- The code splits the number into two halves: the first half is directly compared with the reversed version of the second half.
- This approach avoids converting the number into a string, which saves memory and unnecessary operations, making the code more efficient.
