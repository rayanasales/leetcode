## How the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm Works?

1. This algorithm works by keeping track of a `candidate` for the majority element and a `count` of how many times that candidate appears relative to other elements.
   - If `count == 0`, it means we don't have a candidate, so we set the current number as the new `candidate`.
   - If the current number is equal to the `candidate`, we increment the `count` (i.e., we see more of the same element).
   - If the current number is not equal to the `candidate`, we decrement the `count` (i.e., we see an element that "cancels out" the candidate).
2. Why It Works: Since the majority element appears more than `n/2` times, the non-majority elements cannot "outvote" it. By the end of the array, the `candidate` will be the majority element.

## Why Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm ?

We use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to solve the Majority Element problem because it is one of the most efficient algorithms in terms of time complexity and space complexity. The problem asks us to find the element that appears more than `n / 2` times in an array, where `n` is the length of the array. The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is perfectly suited for this problem for several key reasons:

1. **Linear Time Complexity (O(n))**
   - The algorithm only requires a single pass through the array. This means that it examines each element exactly once, making it an O(n) solution. For large arrays (up to `5 * 10^4` elements, as allowed by the problem's constraints), this ensures that the solution will run efficiently without re-scanning the array multiple times.
   - Many brute-force solutions or less efficient algorithms might involve multiple loops or nested loops (such as counting occurrences of each element), leading to O(n¬≤) time complexity. Such solutions would be slower and unsuitable for larger datasets.
2. **Constant Space Complexity (O(1))**
   - The algorithm only uses two variables: `candidate` (to store the current majority element candidate) and `count` (to track how confident we are that the candidate is the majority element). This means it only uses O(1) additional space, making it extremely memory-efficient.
   - Other potential solutions, such as using a hash map to count the occurrences of each element, would require O(n) space, which is less efficient and not ideal when space is limited or when dealing with very large inputs.
3. **Why It Works for the Majority Element Problem**
   - The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than `n / 2` times in the array. This means that no other element can appear more frequently than the majority element.
   - The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm exploits this property:
     - It tracks a `candidate` for the majority element.
     - As we iterate through the array, we increment a counter when we see the `candidate` and decrement it when we see a different element.
     - When the counter reaches zero, we assume that any previous "candidate" has been "outvoted" and choose a new candidate.
     - However, since the majority element appears more than `n / 2` times, the "correct" majority element cannot be outvoted by other elements. By the end of the array, the majority element will inevitably emerge as the final `candidate`, even if other elements temporarily bring the counter down to zero.
4. **It Guarantees the Majority Element**
   - One key feature of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is that it guarantees that the final `candidate` will be the majority element, as long as the majority element exists (which is given by the problem's constraints).
   - After one full pass through the array, the algorithm guarantees that:
     - The final `candidate` is the majority element if such an element exists.
     - We don't need a second pass to verify, which is why the algorithm remains in O(n) time.
5. **Simple and Elegant Approach**
   - The Boyer-Moore algorithm is straightforward.
     - We simply iterate over the array.
     - We adjust the `count` up or down depending on whether the current element matches the `candidate`.
     - If `count` reaches zero, we switch the `candidate` to the current element.
   - This simplicity makes the algorithm both easy to implement and understand, with no need for complex data structures or multiple loops. The elegance of this algorithm is that it leverages the majority element's fundamental property without needing extra memory or additional processing steps.

## Example to Illustrate

Let's take an example array `[3, 2, 3]`:

1. We start with `candidate = null` and `count = 0`.
2. We process the first element `3`, setting `candidate = 3` and incrementing `count` to `1`.
3. We process the second element `2`, which is not equal to `candidate`, so we decrement `count` to `0`.
4. Now that `count` is `0`, we reset the `candidate` to `3` and increment `count` again to `1` when we see the last element `3`.

Since `3` is the majority element (it appears more than `n / 2` times), the algorithm correctly identifies `3` as the result.

## Solution

```Java []
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize count and candidate
        int count = 0;
        int candidate = 0;

        // Iterate over each element in the nums array
        for (int num : nums) {
            // If count is 0, we set the candidate to the current number
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }

            // If the current number is equal to the candidate, increment the count
            // Otherwise, decrement the count
            if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        // Return the candidate, which will be the majority element
        return candidate;
    }
}
```

```Javascript []
var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    // Initialize count and candidate
    let count = 0;
    let candidate = 0;

    // Iterate over each element in the nums array
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let num = nums[i];

        // If count is 0, we set the candidate to the current number
        if (count === 0) {
            candidate = num;
        }

        // If the current number is equal to the candidate, increment the count
        // Otherwise, decrement the count
        if (num === candidate) {
            count++;
        } else {
            count--;
        }
    }

    // Return the candidate, which will be the majority element
    return candidate;
};
```

## Debugging for Input Examples

### Example 1: nums = [3, 2, 3]

1. Initial State: `count = 0`, `candidate = 0`.
2. First element (`3`):
   - Since `count == 0`, we set `candidate = 3`.
   - Increment `count` to `1`.
   - Current state: `candidate = 3`, `count = 1`.
3. Second element (`2`):
   - `2` is not equal to `candidate` (`3`), so decrement `count` to `0`.
   - Current state: `candidate = 3`, `count = 0`.
4. Third element (`3`):
   - Since `count == 0`, set `candidate = 3`.
   - Increment `count` to `1`.
