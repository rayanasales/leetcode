```java []
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize 'n' as 0. This variable will store the sum of integers
        // from 1 to the length of the array 'nums'.
        int n = 0;

        // First for loop: We iterate over the range from 1 to the length of the array.
        // For each i in this range, we add it to 'n'. By the end of the loop, 'n' will
        // hold the sum of all integers from 1 to nums.length.
        for (int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
            n += i;
        }

        // Second for loop: Now, we iterate over the array 'nums' itself.
        // In each iteration, we subtract the value of nums[i] from 'n'.
        // This effectively removes the numbers present in the array from the sum
        // we calculated in the previous loop. At the end of this loop,
        // the remaining value in 'n' will be the missing number.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            n -= nums[i];
        }

        // The remaining value in 'n' is the missing number, so we return it.
        return n;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

The function `missingNumber` is designed to find the missing number from a sequence of integers ranging from `0` to `n`. The approach in this solution uses two steps to achieve the result: summing all integers from `1` to `n`, and then subtracting the values present in the input array to isolate the missing number.

### **Steps Breakdown:**

1. **Initialize Sum (`n`):**

   - The variable `n` is initialized to `0`. This variable will hold the sum of all numbers from `1` to `nums.length`.
   - In the first loop, we add all the integers from `1` to the length of the array (`nums.length`) to `n`. For example, if the length of the array is 3, `n` will accumulate the sum `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

2. **Subtract Array Elements:**

   - In the second loop, we iterate through the actual input array `nums`. For each element in the array, we subtract its value from `n`.
   - By subtracting the elements in the array, we are effectively removing those numbers from the sum. After this loop, only the missing number remains in `n`, as all other numbers from `1` to `nums.length` have been subtracted.

3. **Return the Missing Number:**
   - Finally, the function returns the remaining value in `n`, which is the missing number from the sequence.

### **Efficiency:**

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)

  - The function has two loops that each iterate over the array, so the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array.

- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \)
  - The function uses only a constant amount of extra space (the variable `n`), so the space complexity is constant.

This approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging the mathematical summation of the first `n` natural numbers, and subtracting the values of the numbers present in the array to isolate the missing number.
