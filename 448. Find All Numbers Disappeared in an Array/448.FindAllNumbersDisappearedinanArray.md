## 🌎 Strategy

The problem asks us to find all missing numbers from an array `nums`, where the numbers are expected to be in the range from `1` to `n`. The challenge also asks if we can solve the problem in **O(n)** time complexity and without using extra space (besides the returned result).

To solve this efficiently:

- We need to avoid using additional arrays or sets that occupy space proportional to the input size.
- The idea is to manipulate the input array `nums` to indicate which numbers are present by marking the indices corresponding to the values.

---

## 🔦 Plan to solve the problem

1. **Array Initialization**: We create an array `all` of size `n + 1`, initialized with `undefined` values. This helps us track the presence of numbers in the range `1` to `n`.
2. **Set for Uniqueness**: We convert the input array `nums` into a set (`uniqNums`) to remove any duplicate values. This ensures we only process each number once.
3. **Marking Numbers**: For each number in `uniqNums`, we mark its corresponding index in the `all` array.
4. **Finding Missing Numbers**: We loop through the `all` array from index 1 to `n`, and if an index is still `undefined`, it means that number is missing from the input array.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of missing numbers.

## 🚀 Solution

```javascript []
var findDisappearedNumbers = function (nums) {
  let size = nums.length + 1;
  let all = Array.apply(null, Array(size));
  let uniqNums = [...new Set(nums)];

  uniqNums.forEach((n) => (all[n] = n));

  let missingNums = [];
  for (let i = 1; i < size; i++) if (!all[i]) missingNums.push(i);

  return missingNums;
};
```

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

### Example 1: Input: `nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`

1. Initialize `all` array of size 9: `[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]`.
2. Remove duplicates from `nums`: `uniqNums = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 1]`.
3. Mark positions in the `all` array:
   - Mark index 4: `[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, 4, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]`.
   - Mark index 3: `[undefined, undefined, undefined, 3, 4, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]`.
   - Mark index 2: `[undefined, undefined, 2, 3, 4, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]`.
   - Mark index 7: `[undefined, undefined, 2, 3, 4, undefined, undefined, 7, undefined]`.
   - Mark index 8: `[undefined, undefined, 2, 3, 4, undefined, undefined, 7, 8]`.
   - Mark index 1: `[undefined, 1, 2, 3, 4, undefined, undefined, 7, 8]`.
4. Find missing numbers: Positions 5 and 6 are still `undefined`, so the output is `[5, 6]`.

**Output**: `[5, 6]`.

### Example 2: Input: `nums = [1,1]`

1. Initialize `all` array of size 3: `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`.
2. Remove duplicates: `uniqNums = [1]`.
3. Mark positions in the `all` array:
   - Mark index 1: `[undefined, 1, undefined]`.
4. Find missing numbers: Position 2 is still `undefined`, so the output is `[2]`.

**Output**: `[2]`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n). This is because:

  - We iterate over the input array `nums` once to create the set of unique numbers.
  - We then iterate over the set of unique numbers to mark them in the `all` array.
  - Finally, we perform a linear scan to identify missing numbers.

  Overall, the number of operations scales linearly with the size of the input array.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array.
  - The `all` array is of size `n + 1`.
  - The `uniqNums` array is derived from `nums`, but the total space is proportional to `n`.
