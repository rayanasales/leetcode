## 🌎 Strategy

The task is to find the intersection of two arrays, where each element in the result must be unique. We aimed for the most efficient solution, optimizing for both **runtime** (achieving 0 ms) and **space**.

### Steps:

1. **Boolean Array for Tracking:** Since the input constraints state that all numbers are between `0` and `1000`, we can use a fixed-size boolean array (size `1001`) to efficiently track which numbers appear in the first array (`nums1`).
2. **Avoid Duplicate Checking:** As we iterate over the second array (`nums2`), we only check for numbers that were seen in `nums1`. Additionally, we use a second boolean array to ensure no duplicates are added to the result.
3. **Two Simple Passes:** We make only two linear passes over the arrays, avoiding the need for nested loops or more complex data structures like sets or hashmaps, which would add overhead.

This strategy results in an **O(n + m)** time complexity, where n and m are the sizes of the two arrays, and it guarantees minimal memory usage with fixed-space tracking arrays.

## 🚀 Commented Solution (Java Beats 100%)

```java []
class Solution {
    public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        // Step 1: Create a boolean array to track the presence of numbers in nums1
        boolean[] seen = new boolean[1001];
        for (int num : nums1) {
            seen[num] = true;  // Mark numbers present in nums1
        }

        // Step 2: Create a temporary array for the intersection result
        int[] tempResult = new int[1001];
        int index = 0;

        // Step 3: Traverse nums2 and check for intersection, avoiding duplicates
        boolean[] added = new boolean[1001];  // To track numbers already added to the result
        for (int num : nums2) {
            if (seen[num] && !added[num]) {
                tempResult[index++] = num;  // Add number to result
                added[num] = true;  // Mark it as added to avoid duplicates
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Copy the result to an array of the correct size
        int[] result = new int[index];
        System.arraycopy(tempResult, 0, result, 0, index);
        return result;
    }
}
```

```javascript []
var intersection = function (nums1, nums2) {
  // Step 1: Track presence of nums1 in boolean array
  let seen = new Array(1001).fill(false);
  nums1.forEach((num) => (seen[num] = true));

  // Step 2: Collect results avoiding duplicates
  let added = new Array(1001).fill(false);
  let result = [];

  nums2.forEach((num) => {
    if (seen[num] && !added[num]) {
      result.push(num);
      added[num] = true;
    }
  });

  return result;
};
```

## 🔎 Debug Demonstration for All Test Cases

### Test Case 1:

Input: `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]`, `nums2 = [2, 2]`

1. **Step 1:** After traversing `nums1`, the `seen` array will mark `1` and `2` as `true`.
2. **Step 2:** When traversing `nums2`, `2` is found in `seen` and is added to the result.
   - Result after traversal: `[2]`

Output: `[2]`

### Test Case 2:

Input: `nums1 = [4, 9, 5]`, `nums2 = [9, 4, 9, 8, 4]`

1. **Step 1:** After traversing `nums1`, the `seen` array will mark `4`, `9`, and `5` as `true`.
2. **Step 2:** Traversing `nums2`, both `9` and `4` are found in `seen` and added to the result (duplicates are skipped).
   - Result after traversal: `[9, 4]`

Output: `[9, 4]` or `[4, 9]` (order doesn’t matter).

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n + m):**
  - We traverse both `nums1` and `nums2` arrays once, making the time complexity linear with respect to the size of both arrays.
  - The sorting or hashing overhead that might occur in other approaches is avoided here by using simple boolean arrays for O(1) membership checks.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(1):**
  - The space complexity is considered **O(1)** (ignoring input and output) because we use fixed-size boolean arrays (`seen` and `added`) with size `1001`, which does not depend on the size of the input.
  - This is optimal compared to using extra sets or hashmaps, which have a variable memory overhead.
