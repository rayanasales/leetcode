## Background: everything you need to know

- **Promise:** A promise is used to handle the asynchronous operation of `fn`. It ensures that we can resolve or reject based on the outcome of `fn`.
- **Timeout (`setTimeout`):** This is used to enforce the time limit. If `fn` takes too long, we reject the promise.
- **`finally`:** This block ensures that the timer is always cleared, preventing any unnecessary timers from running.

## Solution in javascript

```js
var timeLimit = function (fn, t) {
  return async function (...args) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => reject("Time Limit Exceeded"), t);
      fn(...args)
        .then(resolve)
        .catch(reject);
    });
  };
};
```

## Explanation

The `timeLimit` function is designed to wrap an asynchronous function `fn` with a time limit. If the function `fn` doesn't complete within the specified time `t`, the wrapped function will reject with the message `"Time Limit Exceeded"`. Let's break down how this code works.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Function Declaration:**

   ```javascript
   var timeLimit = function (fn, t) {
   ```

   The `timeLimit` function takes two parameters:

   - `fn`: This is the asynchronous function that you want to limit in time.
   - `t`: This is the time limit in milliseconds.

2. **Returning a New Function:**

   ```javascript
   return async function (...args) {
   ```

   The `timeLimit` function returns a new asynchronous function that can accept any number of arguments (`...args`). This new function will wrap the original function `fn` and enforce the time limit.

3. **Creating a New Promise:**

   ```javascript
   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   ```

   Inside the returned function, we create a new `Promise`. This promise will either:

   - Resolve with the result of `fn`, or
   - Reject if `fn` doesn't complete within the time limit.

4. **Setting the Time Limit:**

   ```javascript
   const timer = setTimeout(() => {
     reject("Time Limit Exceeded");
   }, t);
   ```

   We use `setTimeout` to start a timer that will automatically reject the promise if the time limit `t` is reached. The rejection message is `"Time Limit Exceeded"`.

5. **Executing the Function `fn`:**

   ```javascript
   fn(...args)
     .then((result) => {
       resolve(result);
     })
     .catch((err) => {
       reject(err);
     });
   ```

   We call `fn` with the arguments passed to the wrapped function. If `fn` successfully resolves (i.e., completes within the time limit), we resolve the promise with the result. If `fn` rejects (i.e., an error occurs), we reject the promise with the error.

6. **Cleaning Up the Timer:**
   ```javascript
   .finally(result => {
       clearTimeout(timer);
   });
   ```
   The `.finally` block runs after `fn` has either resolved or rejected. It ensures that the timer is cleared (i.e., stopped) no matter what happens. This is important because if the timer isn't cleared, it could lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
