## Javascript Solution

```jsx
var wordPattern = function (pattern, s) {
  // Split the string 's' into an array of words
  const words = s.split(" ");

  // If the length of the pattern doesn't match the number of words, return false immediately
  if (pattern.length !== words.length) return false;

  // Create two Maps to track the mappings between pattern characters and words
  const patternToWord = new Map(); // Maps characters from the pattern to words in 's'
  const wordToPattern = new Map(); // Maps words from 's' to characters in the pattern

  // Iterate through each character in the pattern and the corresponding word in 's'
  for (let i = 0; i < pattern.length; i++) {
    const char = pattern[i]; // Current character from the pattern
    const word = words[i]; // Corresponding word from 's'

    // Check if the current character is already mapped to a word
    if (
      (patternToWord.has(char) && patternToWord.get(char) !== word) || // Check if existing mapping is consistent
      (wordToPattern.has(word) && wordToPattern.get(word) !== char) // Check if the word is already mapped to a different character
    ) {
      return false; // If there's a mismatch in the mapping, return false
    }

    // If no inconsistencies were found, create the mappings
    patternToWord.set(char, word); // Map the character to the word
    wordToPattern.set(word, char); // Map the word to the character
  }

  // If all checks pass, return true indicating the pattern matches the string
  return true;
};
```

## Detailed Explanation of the Strategy

This solution efficiently checks if a string `s` follows a specified pattern. The goal is to ensure that there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters in `pattern` and the words in `s`. Here’s a breakdown of the strategy used:

1. **Splitting the String:**
   - The input string `s` is split into an array of words using `split(' ')`. This converts the string into an array where each word corresponds to a space-separated segment in the string.
2. **Length Check:**
   - Before proceeding with any further checks, the function immediately compares the length of the `pattern` with the number of words in `s`. If the lengths don’t match, the pattern cannot possibly be followed, so the function returns `false` right away.
3. **Using Maps for Bidirectional Mapping:**
   - Two `Map` objects are used to store the mappings:
     - `patternToWord` stores the mapping from each character in the `pattern` to the corresponding word in `s`.
     - `wordToPattern` stores the mapping from each word in `s` to the corresponding character in the `pattern`.
   - These `Map` objects help ensure that the mapping is consistent and bidirectional.
4. **Iterating Over the Pattern and Words:**
   - The function iterates through the `pattern` and the array of `words` simultaneously. For each character in the `pattern` and its corresponding word in `s`, the function performs the following checks:
     - **Consistency Check:**
       - It first checks if the current character `char` from the `pattern` has already been mapped to a word. If so, the function verifies that the word it maps to is the current word. If there’s a mismatch, the function returns `false`.
       - Similarly, it checks if the current word has already been mapped to a different character. If there's any inconsistency, the function also returns `false`.
     - **Mapping Creation:**
       - If no inconsistencies are found, the function maps the current character to the word and vice versa using the `set` method of the `Map` object.
5. **Final Check:**
   - If the loop completes without encountering any inconsistencies, the function returns `true`, indicating that the string `s` follows the given pattern.

## Why This Approach Works

- **Bidirectional Mapping:**
  - The solution ensures that both mappings (from pattern to word and word to pattern) are consistent, which is crucial for correctly following the pattern. This prevents any character in the pattern from mapping to multiple different words, and vice versa.
- **Efficiency:**
  - By using `Map` objects, the solution leverages efficient O(1) average time complexity for insertions and lookups, making the approach fast even for larger inputs.
- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The solution correctly handles edge cases such as patterns and strings of different lengths, as well as cases where multiple characters might incorrectly map to the same word.
