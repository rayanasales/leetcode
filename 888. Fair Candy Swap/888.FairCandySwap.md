## üåé **Strategy**

The goal of this challenge is for Alice and Bob to exchange **one candy box each** so that after the exchange, they both have the **same total amount of candy**.

### **Steps:**

1. **Calculate the Total Candies for Alice and Bob:**

   - Sum up all the candy boxes for Alice and Bob to get `totalAlice` and `totalBob`.

2. **Find the Difference:**

   - Calculate the difference between the total number of candies Alice and Bob have.
   - The equation **Difference = (totalAlice - totalBob) / 2** helps us understand how much more (or fewer) candies Alice has compared to Bob.

3. **Swapping Strategy:**

   - We need to find two numbers:
     - `a` (the number of candies in the box Alice will give to Bob)
     - `b` (the number of candies in the box Bob will give to Alice).
   - The swap should satisfy the equation **`a = b + Difference`**.
   - In simpler terms, Alice needs to give a box that has `Difference` more candies than the box Bob gives her.

4. **Efficient Lookup:**
   - We use a **Set** to store Bob‚Äôs candy box sizes for fast lookup, reducing the time complexity of searching for Bob‚Äôs corresponding box.

### **Plan for Optimization**

- **Optimized Search with Set:**  
  Instead of using a double loop to compare all combinations of Alice‚Äôs and Bob‚Äôs boxes, we utilize a **Set** to store Bob‚Äôs candy sizes. This allows for **O(1)** time complexity when looking up whether Bob has a box that satisfies the equation `a = b + Difference`. This significantly speeds up the solution compared to a brute-force approach.

## üöÄ **Code Solution**

```javascript []
var fairCandySwap = function (aliceSizes, bobSizes) {
  // Calculate total candies for Alice and Bob
  let totalAlice = aliceSizes.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  let totalBob = bobSizes.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

  // Calculate the difference (NOT absolute value!)
  let diff = (totalAlice - totalBob) / 2;

  // Use a Set for Bob's sizes for faster lookup
  let bobSet = new Set(bobSizes);

  // Find the correct pair (a, b)
  for (let a of aliceSizes) {
    let b = a - diff; // Based on equation a = b + diff
    if (bobSet.has(b)) return [a, b];
  }

  return [];
};
```

## üîé **Step-by-Step Debugging**

Let‚Äôs walk through the debugging process using example test cases:

### **Test Case 1:**

- **Input:** `aliceSizes = [1, 1]`, `bobSizes = [2, 2]`
- **Step 1:** Calculate totals:
  - `totalAlice = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `totalBob = 2 + 2 = 4`
- **Step 2:** Calculate the difference:
  - `diff = (2 - 4) / 2 = -1`
- **Step 3:** Use the equation `a = b + diff` to find valid pairs:
  - Alice‚Äôs box sizes: `1`, `1`
  - Bob‚Äôs box sizes: `2`, `2`
  - Check the first box Alice can give (1):
    - `b = a - diff = 1 - (-1) = 2`
    - Bob has a box with size 2.
- **Output:** `[1, 2]`

### **Test Case 2:**

- **Input:** `aliceSizes = [1, 2]`, `bobSizes = [2, 3]`
- **Step 1:** Calculate totals:
  - `totalAlice = 1 + 2 = 3`
  - `totalBob = 2 + 3 = 5`
- **Step 2:** Calculate the difference:
  - `diff = (3 - 5) / 2 = -1`
- **Step 3:** Use the equation `a = b + diff` to find valid pairs:
  - Alice‚Äôs box sizes: `1`, `2`
  - Bob‚Äôs box sizes: `2`, `3`
  - Check the first box Alice can give (1):
    - `b = 1 - (-1) = 2`
    - Bob has a box with size 2.
- **Output:** `[1, 2]`

### **Test Case 3:**

- **Input:** `aliceSizes = [2]`, `bobSizes = [1, 3]`
- **Step 1:** Calculate totals:
  - `totalAlice = 2`
  - `totalBob = 1 + 3 = 4`
- **Step 2:** Calculate the difference:
  - `diff = (2 - 4) / 2 = -1`
- **Step 3:** Use the equation `a = b + diff` to find valid pairs:
  - Alice‚Äôs box sizes: `2`
  - Bob‚Äôs box sizes: `1`, `3`
  - Check the first box Alice can give (2):
    - `b = 2 - (-1) = 3`
    - Bob has a box with size 3.
- **Output:** `[2, 3]`

## üìä **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

### **Time Complexity:**

- **Calculating the totals**:  
  We sum the sizes of Alice's and Bob's boxes. This takes **O(n)** and **O(m)** time respectively, where `n` is the length of `aliceSizes` and `m` is the length of `bobSizes`.

- **Set creation for Bob's candy sizes**:  
  Creating a Set for Bob's box sizes takes **O(m)** time, as we need to insert each element once.

- **Finding the valid pair**:  
  We iterate through Alice‚Äôs candy sizes, and for each size, we check if Bob has the corresponding box using the Set. Since Set lookups are O(1), this step takes **O(n)** time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m)**, which is very efficient.

### **Space Complexity:**

- We use **O(m)** space to store Bob's candy sizes in a Set.
- The space required for the result is constant (since we only return a pair of values).

Thus, the space complexity is **O(m)**.
