## Solution

```jsx
function convertToTitle(columnNumber) {
  // The alphabet string includes a placeholder '#' at the beginning.
  // This allows for easy indexing where 'A' corresponds to index 1, 'B' to 2, ..., 'Z' to 26.
  const alphabet = "#ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

  // Initialize an empty array to store the resulting characters.
  const ans = [];
  /* The approximate number system (ANS) is a cognitive system that supports the estimation of the magnitude of a group without relying on language or symbols.

    */

  // Loop until the columnNumber is reduced to 0
  while (columnNumber > 0) {
    // Determine the corresponding letter by using the modulus operation.
    // If the remainder is 0, it corresponds to 'Z' (26), otherwise, it's a direct mapping.
    const index = columnNumber % 26 === 0 ? 26 : columnNumber % 26;

    // Add the corresponding letter to the result array.
    ans.push(alphabet[index]);

    // Update the columnNumber:
    // If the remainder was 0 (meaning we added 'Z'), subtract 26, otherwise, subtract the remainder.
    // Then, divide by 26 to move to the next "digit" in the 26-base system.
    columnNumber = (columnNumber - index) / 26;
  }

  // The result array contains the characters in reverse order, so we reverse it.
  // Finally, we join the array into a single string and return it.
  return ans.reverse().join("");
}
```

## Explanation

### The strategy:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem is about converting a column number (like those used in Excel) into a corresponding column title.
   - Excel uses a base-26 system where 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., 'Z' to 26. After 'Z', it goes to 'AA' (27), 'AB' (28), and so on.
2. **Base-26 System**:
   - Just like how we use base-10 (decimal) for numbers, Excel columns use base-26, but with the twist that there is no zero digit. Instead, 'A' represents 1, 'B' represents 2, and so on, with 'Z' representing 26.
3. **Looping to Convert**:
   - We continuously divide the column number by 26 to find each "digit" (or character in this case) in the column title.
   - The remainder of this division (`columnNumber % 26`) tells us which letter corresponds to the current position. For example, a remainder of 1 corresponds to 'A', 2 to 'B', and so on.
4. **Special Case for 'Z'**:
   - If the remainder is 0, it means the current character should be 'Z'. This is because, in a 1-based system, 26 is represented by 'Z', not by 'A0' as in a traditional numeral system.
5. **Updating the Column Number**:
   - After determining the current character, we adjust the `columnNumber` by subtracting the value that this character represents (`26` if 'Z', or the remainder) and divide by 26 to move to the next character.
6. **Reversing the Result**:
   - The characters are determined from the least significant to the most significant (right to left), so the result array is in reverse order. We reverse the array and then join it into a single string to get the final column title.
7. **Efficiency**:
   - The code is efficient because it minimizes operations inside the loop, and by using an array to accumulate the result, we avoid costly string concatenations in the loop.
