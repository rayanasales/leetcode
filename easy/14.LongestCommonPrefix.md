[Longest Common Prefix - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/description/)

# Solution

```jsx
var longestCommonPrefix = function (strs) {
  // If the array is empty, return an empty string
  if (strs.length === 0) return "";

  // Take the first string as the initial prefix
  let prefix = strs[0];

  // Iterate over the rest of the strings in the array
  for (let i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
    // Compare the current string with the prefix
    // Reduce the prefix until it matches the start of the current string
    while (strs[i].indexOf(prefix) !== 0) {
      // Shorten the prefix by one character from the end
      prefix = prefix.substring(0, prefix.length - 1);

      // If prefix becomes empty, return ""
      if (prefix === "") return "";
    }
  }

  // Return the final common prefix
  return prefix;
};
```

# Explanation

The function `longestCommonPrefix` is designed to find the longest common prefix shared by all the strings in a given array.

1. **Initialization:**
   - It starts by checking if the input array is empty. If it is, the function immediately returns an empty string because there can't be any common prefix.
   - The first string in the array is initially assumed to be the common prefix.
2. **Iterative Comparison:**
   - The function then iterates through each of the remaining strings in the array. For each string, it checks if the current prefix is a prefix of that string.
   - If the current prefix is not found at the start of the string (i.e., `indexOf(prefix) !== 0`), the prefix is gradually shortened by removing the last character until it matches the start of the string.
   - This process ensures that the prefix is always the longest possible prefix that is common to all the strings examined so far.
3. **Termination:**
   - The loop continues until all strings in the array have been checked. If, at any point, the prefix becomes an empty string, the function returns an empty string immediately, as no common prefix exists.
   - If the loop completes, the final value of `prefix` is returned, which represents the longest common prefix shared by all the strings in the array.

### **Efficiency:**

The function is efficient because it only reduces the prefix when necessary, ensuring that each character of each string is only compared as needed. The time complexity is linear in terms of the total number of characters across all strings, making it a performant solution for this problem.
