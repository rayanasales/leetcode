### ü§ôüòöü§ò Timeout Cancellation with JavaScript | ‚úÖ simple, beginner friendly

This approach uses closures and JavaScript's `setTimeout()` to control when functions execute‚Äîor don't. Let's dive right in and see how this works!

```javascript
var cancellable = function (fn, args, t) {
  let timeoutId;

  const cancelFn = () => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  };

  timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    fn(...args);
  }, t);

  return cancelFn;
};

/**
 * Example usage:
 */
const result = [];
const fn = (x) => x * 5;
const args = [2],
  t = 20,
  cancelTimeMs = 50;
const start = performance.now();

const log = (...argsArr) => {
  const diff = Math.floor(performance.now() - start);
  result.push({ time: diff, returned: fn(...argsArr) });
};

const cancel = cancellable(log, args, t);
setTimeout(cancel, cancelTimeMs);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(result); // Check out the results
}, Math.max(t, cancelTimeMs) + 15);
```

**Here‚Äôs the lowdown:**

1. **Function Setup:** The `cancellable` function accepts any function `fn`, its arguments `args`, and a delay `t`. It handles setting up and potentially canceling the function's execution.
2. **Cancellation Magic:** We keep track of the timeout ID when we set up the timeout. If you want to stop `fn` from firing, just call `cancelFn`‚Äîit uses `clearTimeout` to cancel the timeout.
3. **Flexible Usage:** You can adapt this pattern to delay or cancel just about any operation in JavaScript. Super handy for user interactions, API calls, or any scenario where timing is crucial.

**Example Explained:**

In this example, I created a simple function `log` that multiplies an input by 5 and logs it with a timestamp. We set it to execute after 20 milliseconds. However, we also prepare to cancel it after 50 milliseconds‚Äîbefore it has a chance to run. If you play around with `cancelTimeMs` and `t`, you can see how the behavior changes.
