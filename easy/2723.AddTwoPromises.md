## One-Line Solution: Beginner-Friendly Promise Addition! 🌟🌟🌟

### Understanding Promises: A Quick Overview

Promises in JavaScript are like IOUs. When you ask JavaScript to do something that takes some time (like fetching data or waiting for a timer), it gives you a Promise. This Promise is a commitment to give you the result as soon as it’s ready, letting your code move on to other tasks in the meantime.

### The Magical One-Line Code

Now, let’s look at a super concise way to add two Promises together:

```javascript
var addTwoPromises = async function (promise1, promise2) {
  return (await promise1) + (await promise2);
};
```

### Breaking It Down

- **Async Function:** The `async` keyword before the function makes it asynchronous. This means it can perform tasks that take some time to complete, like waiting for a Promise.
- **Await:** When you see `await`, it tells JavaScript, "Pause here, don’t move on until the Promise is resolved."
- **Adding Promises:** Inside the function, we `await` both `promise1` and `promise2`. This means we wait for both Promises to resolve (give us their values). Once they do, we simply add those values together.

### Example in Action

```javascript
addTwoPromises(Promise.resolve(2), Promise.resolve(2)).then(console.log); // Outputs: 4
```

- **Promise.resolve(2):** This creates a Promise that immediately resolves to the value 2.
- **.then(console.log):** Once our function `addTwoPromises` completes, `.then()` is used to handle the result. Here, it logs the result to the console.
