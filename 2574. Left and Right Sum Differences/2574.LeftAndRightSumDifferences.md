## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var leftRightDifference = function (nums) {
  let numsDiff = [],
    leftSum = 0;
  let rightSum = nums.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    rightSum -= nums[i];
    numsDiff[i] = Math.abs(leftSum - rightSum);
    leftSum += nums[i];
  }
  return numsDiff;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

The strategy for solving the "Left and Right Sum Differences" problem efficiently involves calculating the sums dynamically to avoid redundancy. The approach can be broken down into a few clear steps:

1. Initial Total Calculation: Before starting the main loop, calculate the total sum of all elements in the array `nums`. This value represents the sum of all elements to the right of the current index as we begin the loop (since we start at index 0).

2. Iterative Calculation:

   - As we iterate through the array, maintain two sums: `leftSum` and `rightSum`.
   - The `rightSum` is initialized as the sum of all elements. With each iteration, subtract the current element from `rightSum` before computing the difference. This subtraction effectively shifts the boundary of the `rightSum` from including to excluding the current element.
   - Compute the absolute difference between `leftSum` and `rightSum` for the current index and store it in the result array (`numsDiff`).
   - After computing the difference, add the current element to `leftSum`. This prepares `leftSum` for the next iteration by including the current element in it.

3. Final Result:
   - The result array `numsDiff` is populated in each iteration with the absolute difference between sums to the left and right of each index, providing the required output directly.

This method ensures that each element is only processed once for sum adjustments, making it efficient and straightforward.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s debug the provided example:

- Example 1: `nums = [10, 4, 8, 3]`
  - Initial Right Sum Calculation: `rightSum = 10 + 4 + 8 + 3 = 25`
  - Iterations:
    - i = 0: `rightSum` before = 25, after subtracting current (10) = 15, `leftSum` = 0. Difference = |0 - 15| = 15.
    - i = 1: `rightSum` before = 15, after subtracting current (4) = 11, `leftSum` = 10. Difference = |10 - 11| = 1.
    - i = 2: `rightSum` before = 11, after subtracting current (8) = 3, `leftSum` = 14. Difference = |14 - 3| = 11.
    - i = 3: `rightSum` before = 3, after subtracting current (3) = 0, `leftSum` = 22. Difference = |22 - 0| = 22.
  - Result: `[15, 1, 11, 22]`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n) because the main loop runs through each element exactly once and performs a constant amount of work for each element (updating sums and computing differences).

- Space Complexity: O(n) for the output array `numsDiff`. The input array `nums` is not modified, and no additional significant space is used.
