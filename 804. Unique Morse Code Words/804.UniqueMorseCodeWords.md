## 🌎 **Strategy**

The task is to count how many unique Morse code transformations can be generated from a list of words. Each letter in the word is converted into a Morse code equivalent, and then we compare the transformations of all the words in the list. The goal is to determine how many distinct Morse transformations exist.

### **Detailed Strategy:**

1. **Morse Code Mapping:**  
   Create a dictionary where each letter of the alphabet is mapped to its corresponding Morse code.
2. **Transform Each Word:**  
   For each word in the input array `words`, convert each letter of the word to its corresponding Morse code representation, and concatenate them to form the word’s "Morse transformation".

3. **Store Unique Transformations:**  
   We can use an array to track transformations and avoid duplicates by checking if each transformation is already stored before adding it.

4. **Return the Count:**  
   After processing all words, the final count of unique transformations is the length of the array holding them.

### **Plan for Optimization:**

While the current solution uses an array to store the unique transformations, checking if a transformation exists using `.includes()` can take linear time. A more efficient approach would be to use a **set** data structure, which allows for constant time checks and avoids duplicates automatically. This would reduce the overall complexity and improve performance.

## 🚀 **Code Solution**

```javascript
var uniqueMorseRepresentations = function (words) {
  let transformations = new Set(); // Set for faster lookups and automatic uniqueness
  const alphabetToMorseCode = {
    a: ".-",
    b: "-...",
    c: "-.-.",
    d: "-..",
    e: ".",
    f: "..-.",
    g: "--.",
    h: "....",
    i: "..",
    j: ".---",
    k: "-.-",
    l: ".-..",
    m: "--",
    n: "-.",
    o: "---",
    p: ".--.",
    q: "--.-",
    r: ".-.",
    s: "...",
    t: "-",
    u: "..-",
    v: "...-",
    w: ".--",
    x: "-..-",
    y: "-.--",
    z: "--..",
  };

  for (let word of words) {
    let transformation = "";
    for (let char of word) {
      transformation += alphabetToMorseCode[char];
    }
    transformations.add(transformation); // Set automatically handles duplicates
  }

  return transformations.size;
};
```

## 🔎 **Step-by-Step Debugging**

Let's walk through the debugging process using the given example inputs:

### Example 1:

- **Input:** `["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]`
  - `"gin"` -> Convert each character to Morse:
    - `'g' -> "--."`, `'i' -> ".."`, `'n' -> "-."`
    - Transformation = `"--...-."`
  - `"zen"` -> Convert each character to Morse:
    - `'z' -> "--.."`, `'e' -> "."`, `'n' -> "-."`
    - Transformation = `"--...-."`
    - This transformation is already present in the set, so it won't be added again.
  - `"gig"` -> Convert each character to Morse:
    - `'g' -> "--."`, `'i' -> ".."`, `'g' -> "--."`
    - Transformation = `"--...--."`
  - `"msg"` -> Convert each character to Morse:
    - `'m' -> "--"`, `'s' -> "..."`, `'g' -> "--."`
    - Transformation = `"--...--."`
    - This transformation is already present in the set, so it won't be added again.
- **Output:**  
  The unique transformations are `["--...-.", "--...--."]`, so the output is `2`.

### Example 2:

- **Input:** `["a"]`
  - `"a"` -> Convert the character to Morse:
    - `'a' -> ".-"`
    - Transformation = `".-"`
- **Output:**  
  There is only one transformation (`[".-"]`), so the output is `1`.

## 📊 **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

### **Time Complexity:**

- **Building Morse Transformation:**  
  For each word, we iterate through its characters to generate the Morse transformation. Each word has a length of `m`, and we do this for `n` words, so the time complexity is **O(n \* m)**, where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of each word.
- **Checking for Unique Transformations:**  
  Using a set ensures that adding transformations and checking for uniqueness takes constant time **O(1)**.

Overall time complexity: **O(n \* m)**.

### **Space Complexity:**

- We store the unique transformations in a set. In the worst case, if all transformations are unique, the set will store `n` transformations, each of size `m`. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(n \* m)**.
