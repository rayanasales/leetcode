## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var findWordsContaining = function (words, x) {
  let indexes = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++)
    if (words[i].indexOf(x) !== -1) indexes.push(i);
  return indexes;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy Explanation

- Initialize: We start by creating an empty array `indexes` to hold the indices of words that contain `x`.
- Loop: For each word in `words`, we use `indexOf` to check if `x` is present.
- Push Index: If `x` is found (`indexOf(x) !== -1`), we add the current index to `indexes`.
- Return Result: Once the loop completes, `indexes` contains all indices of words with `x`.

## ⚡️ Plan for Optimization

### Why `indexOf` is Faster than `includes`

Before achieving this 0ms solution, we tried using `words[i].includes(x)`. While `includes()` is a clean and readable method, it is generally slower in JavaScript because:

- `includes` performs extra type checking and handles edge cases that `indexOf` doesn’t.
- `indexOf` is optimized for performance in situations where we only need to check for the presence of a character without additional overhead.

Using `indexOf` here skips unnecessary checks, resulting in faster execution.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

### Example 1:

Input: `words = ["leet", "code"], x = "e"`

1. Iteration 1: `i = 0`, `words[0] = "leet"`
   - `"leet".indexOf("e") !== -1` is `true`.
   - Add `0` to `indexes`.
2. Iteration 2: `i = 1`, `words[1] = "code"`
   - `"code".indexOf("e") !== -1` is `true`.
   - Add `1` to `indexes`.

Output: `[0, 1]`

### Example 2:

Input: `words = ["abc", "bcd", "aaaa", "cbc"], x = "a"`

1. Iteration 1: `i = 0`, `words[0] = "abc"`
   - `"abc".indexOf("a") !== -1` is `true`.
   - Add `0` to `indexes`.
2. Iteration 2: `i = 1`, `words[1] = "bcd"`
   - `"bcd".indexOf("a") !== -1` is `false`.
3. Iteration 3: `i = 2`, `words[2] = "aaaa"`
   - `"aaaa".indexOf("a") !== -1` is `true`.
   - Add `2` to `indexes`.
4. Iteration 4: `i = 3`, `words[3] = "cbc"`
   - `"cbc".indexOf("a") !== -1` is `false`.

Output: `[0, 2]`

### Example 3:

Input: `words = ["abc", "bcd", "aaaa", "cbc"], x = "z"`

1. Iteration 1: `i = 0`, `words[0] = "abc"`
   - `"abc".indexOf("z") !== -1` is `false`.
2. Iteration 2: `i = 1`, `words[1] = "bcd"`
   - `"bcd".indexOf("z") !== -1` is `false`.
3. Iteration 3: `i = 2`, `words[2] = "aaaa"`
   - `"aaaa".indexOf("z") !== -1` is `false`.
4. Iteration 4: `i = 3`, `words[3] = "cbc"`
   - `"cbc".indexOf("z") !== -1` is `false`.

Output: `[]`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(n \* m)

- Explanation:
  - `n` is the number of words in the `words` array.
  - `m` is the average length of each word.
  - `indexOf` has a linear time complexity relative to the length of the word, so overall complexity is O(n \* m).

### Space Complexity: O(n)

- We create an additional array `indexes` to store the indices of words containing `x`. In the worst case (if every word contains `x`), `indexes` could be of size `n`.
