## Solution in javascript

```Javascript []
function checkIfInstanceOf(obj, classFunction) {
  if (obj === null || obj === undefined) return false;

  if (typeof classFunction !== "function") {
    return false;
  }

  if (typeof obj !== "object" && typeof obj !== "function") {
    obj = Object(obj);
  }

  return obj instanceof classFunction;
}
```

## Explanation

### Handling `null` and `undefined`

```Javascript []
if (obj === null || obj === undefined) return false;
```

- Null and Undefined Check: In JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` are primitive values that represent the absence of a meaningful value. These types do not have properties or prototypes. Thus, they cannot be instances of any class or function. The function immediately returns `false` if `obj` is either `null` or `undefined`.

### Validating the Constructor Function

```Javascript []
if (typeof classFunction !== "function") {
  return false;
}
```

- Function Check: This line ensures that the second argument, `classFunction`, is a function. In JavaScript, the `typeof` operator is used to determine the type of a variable. Functions in JavaScript include function declarations, function expressions, and class declarations, all of which are valid as constructors. The `instanceof` operator requires the right-hand operand to be a function because it needs to access the function's `prototype` property. If `classFunction` is not a function, the function returns `false` to avoid a TypeError.

### Handling Primitives

```Javascript []
if (typeof obj !== "object" && typeof obj !== "function") {
  obj = Object(obj);
}
```

- Primitive to Object Conversion: JavaScript automatically wraps primitive values (like numbers, strings, booleans, symbols, and bigints) with their corresponding object types (like `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, etc.) when properties or methods are accessed. This process is known as "boxing." In the line above, if `obj` is a primitive, it is converted to its wrapper object using `Object(obj)`. This conversion is crucial because primitives themselves do not have a prototype chain, but their wrapper objects do, allowing `instanceof` to function correctly.

### The `instanceof` Operator

```Javascript []
return obj instanceof classFunction;
```

- Using `instanceof`: The `instanceof` operator checks whether the prototype of the constructor (second argument) appears anywhere in the prototype chain of the object (first argument). It returns `true` if the prototype can be found in the chain and `false` otherwise. This operator is a standard way to determine an object's type, taking into account inheritance in JavaScript.

### Summary of the JavaScript Fundamentals Used

1. Null and Undefined: These are basic data types in JavaScript that represent no value or a non-initialized state.
2. Data Types and `typeof` Operator: JavaScript uses the `typeof` operator to determine the type of a variable, which is crucial for ensuring that variables are of expected types before performing operations on them.
3. Objects and Primitives: Understanding the difference between objects and primitives, and how JavaScript treats each, especially concerning method access and property lookup.
4. Prototype Chain: Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, and JavaScript uses prototypes to inherit properties and methods from one object to another, which is fundamental to how the `instanceof` operator works.

These concepts form the backbone of many operations in JavaScript, especially for type-checking and working with objects and constructors in a dynamic environment. This function utilizes these concepts to provide robust type checking that includes handling JavaScript's sometimes quirky behavior with primitives and constructors.
