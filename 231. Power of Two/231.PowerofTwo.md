# Background: everything you need to know

To solve the problem of determining whether a given integer `n` is a power of two, we need to consider the most efficient approach possible. This means avoiding loops or recursion and leveraging bitwise operations, which are both fast and low-overhead.

### **Solution Strategy**

A number `n` is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. For example:

- `1` (binary `0001`) is `2^0`
- `2` (binary `0010`) is `2^1`
- `4` (binary `0100`) is `2^2`

In binary, a power of two has exactly one `1` bit and the rest are `0`s. This characteristic allows us to use a simple bitwise operation to check if `n` is a power of two.

### **Bitwise Trick Explanation**

For any power of two, `n`, the expression `n & (n - 1)` will be `0`. This is because:

- `n` has exactly one bit set to `1`.
- `n - 1` flips all the bits after the rightmost `1` in `n`, including the `1` itself.

Therefore:

- `n & (n - 1)` clears the only `1` bit in `n`, resulting in `0` if `n` is a power of two.

# Solution

```java []
// Java Solution (Runtime 0ms Beats 100.00%)
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // A number n is a power of two if it is greater than 0 and (n & (n - 1)) is 0
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
}
```

```JavaScript []
// JavaScript Solution (Runtime 78ms Beats 45.31%)
var isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {
    // A number n is a power of two if it is greater than 0 and (n & (n - 1)) is 0
    return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) === 0;
};
```

### **Explanation of the Code**

1. **Condition `n > 0`:**
   - We first check if `n` is greater than `0` because a non-positive number (0 or negative) cannot be a power of two.
2. **Bitwise Operation `(n & (n - 1))`:**
   - This checks if `n` has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. If `n` is a power of two, `(n & (n - 1))` will be `0`, confirming that `n` is indeed a power of two.
3. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `true` if both conditions are satisfied, meaning `n` is a power of two; otherwise, it returns `false`.
