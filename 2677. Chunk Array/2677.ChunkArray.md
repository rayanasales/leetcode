## Solution

```Javascript []
var chunk = function (arr, size) {
  let result = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += size) {
    result.push(arr.slice(i, i + size));
  }
  return result;
};
```

## Explanation

The function chunk is designed to split an array into smaller arrays (chunks) of a specified size.

1. Initialization:

   - It initializes an empty array result to store the chunks.

2. Iterative Chunking:

   - The function iterates over the input array arr in steps of size.
   - For each step, it slices a sub-array from the current index i to i + size and pushes this sub-array into the result array.

3. Termination:

   - The loop continues until the end of the array is reached.
   - Finally, the result array, which now contains all the chunks, is returned.
