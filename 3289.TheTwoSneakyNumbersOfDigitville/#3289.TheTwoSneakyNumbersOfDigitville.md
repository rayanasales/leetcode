## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var getSneakyNumbers = function (nums) {
  let unique = [];
  let sneakies = [];

  for (let n of nums) {
    if (sneakies.length == 2) return sneakies;
    !unique.includes(n) ? unique.push(n) : sneakies.push(n);
  }

  return sneakies;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

### Understanding the Approach

1. Track Unique and Duplicate Numbers:

   - We use two arrays: `unique` and `sneakies`.
   - `unique` is meant to store numbers that we encounter for the first time.
   - `sneakies` captures the two numbers that appear twice, allowing us to identify the “sneaky” numbers.

2. Logic to Detect Duplicates:
   - For each number in `nums`, we check if it's already in `unique`.
   - If not, we add it to `unique` as it’s being seen for the first time.
   - If it’s already in `unique`, it’s a duplicate, so we push it to `sneakies`.
   - As soon as we have two numbers in `sneakies`, we return immediately, saving computation time.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Here’s how the code behaves with each example provided:

### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [0, 1, 1, 0]`

1. Iteration 1: `n = 0`
   - `unique` = `[0]`
   - `sneakies` = `[]`
2. Iteration 2: `n = 1`
   - `unique` = `[0, 1]`
   - `sneakies` = `[]`
3. Iteration 3: `n = 1`
   - `unique` = `[0, 1]`
   - `sneakies` = `[1]` (1 is duplicated)
4. Iteration 4: `n = 0`
   - `unique` = `[0, 1]`
   - `sneakies` = `[1, 0]` (0 is duplicated)
5. Return: `[1, 0]`

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2]`

1. Iteration 1: `n = 0` → `unique` = `[0]`, `sneakies` = `[]`
2. Iteration 2: `n = 3` → `unique` = `[0, 3]`, `sneakies` = `[]`
3. Iteration 3: `n = 2` → `unique` = `[0, 3, 2]`, `sneakies` = `[]`
4. Iteration 4: `n = 1` → `unique` = `[0, 3, 2, 1]`, `sneakies` = `[]`
5. Iteration 5: `n = 3` → `sneakies` = `[3]` (3 is duplicated)
6. Iteration 6: `n = 2` → `sneakies` = `[3, 2]` (2 is duplicated)
7. Return: `[3, 2]`

### Example 3:

Input: `nums = [7, 1, 5, 4, 3, 4, 6, 0, 9, 5, 8, 2]`

1. Step-by-step:
   - Track each addition to `unique` and `sneakies` similarly.
   - Result will be `[4, 5]`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Current Solution

- Time Complexity: O(n²) due to the `includes` check in a loop over `nums`.

  - For each element in `nums`, checking `unique.includes(n)` takes up to O(n) time.
  - This results in a worst-case time complexity of O(n²).

- Space Complexity: O(n), as we store each unique number in `unique` and two duplicates in `sneakies`.

### Optimized Solution

- Time Complexity: O(n), with a single loop through `nums` and constant-time operations on the `Set`.
- Space Complexity: O(n), using a Set to store unique elements and an array for `sneakies`.

The optimized solution is significantly faster and uses minimal memory, making it ideal for competitive programming environments like LeetCode.
