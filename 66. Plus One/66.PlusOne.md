## Solution

```java []
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        // Traverse the array from the end to the beginning
        for (int i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            digits[i]++; // Increment the current digit

            // If the digit is less than 10, we can return the result
            if (digits[i] < 10) {
                return digits;
            }

            // If the digit is 10, set it to 0 and carry over the 1
            digits[i] = 0;
        }

        // If all digits were 9, add a 1 at the beginning
        int[] newDigits = new int[digits.length + 1];
        newDigits[0] = 1;

        return newDigits;
    }
}
```

```Javascript []
var plusOne = function (digits) {
  // Traverse the array from the last digit to the first
  for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    digits[i]++; // Increment the current digit

    // If the digit becomes less than 10, no carry, return the array
    if (digits[i] < 10) {
      return digits;
    }

    // If the digit is 10, set it to 0 and carry over the 1
    digits[i] = 0;
  }

  // If we're out of the loop and all digits were 9, we need to add a new digit
  digits.unshift(1);

  return digits;
};
```

## Explanation

The problem, **Plus One**, asks us to increment a large integer represented by an array of digits, where each digit represents a single place in the number. Here's how our solution works in both Java and JavaScript:

### Steps:

1. **Traverse the digits from right to left:**  
   We start by working with the least significant digit (the last one in the array). We increment this digit and check if it becomes 10.
2. **Handle carry:**  
   If the digit turns into 10 (i.e., a carry is generated), we set that digit to `0` and move to the next most significant digit to add the carry (`1`). This process continues until there are no more digits left, or we can return the result.

3. **Edge Case (All digits are 9):**  
   If all digits in the array are `9` (e.g., `[9, 9, 9]`), the final number will need an extra digit to represent the increment (e.g., `[1, 0, 0, 0]`). In this case, we handle the carry by adding a new `1` at the beginning of the array.

### Efficiency:

This solution is highly efficient because it processes each digit only once, working from the last digit toward the first. The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of digits in the array.
