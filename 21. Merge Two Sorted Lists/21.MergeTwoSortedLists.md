## Why recursion?

The recursive approach can indeed make the problem easier to understand by breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces. However, it's important to note that recursion adds to the call stack, which can be a limitation in environments with limited stack space. Despite this, if the simplicity and readability of the code are priorities, recursion is a very elegant solution.

class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        // Base cases: if one of the lists is empty, return the other list
        if (list1 == null) {
            return list2;
        }
        if (list2 == null) {
            return list1;
        }

        // Recursive case: compare the values of the current nodes
        if (list1.val < list2.val) {
            list1.next = mergeTwoLists(list1.next, list2); // Merge the rest of list1 with list2
            return list1; // Return the current node as the next node in the merged list
        } else {
            list2.next = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2.next); // Merge list1 with the rest of list2
            return list2; // Return the current node as the next node in the merged list
        }

var mergeTwoLists = function (list1, list2) {
  // Base cases: if one of the lists is empty, return the other list
  if (list1 === null) {
    return list2;
  }
  if (list2 === null) {
    return list1;
  }

  // Recursive case: compare the values of the current nodes
  if (list1.val < list2.val) {
    list1.next = mergeTwoLists(list1.next, list2); // Merge the rest of list1 with list2
    return list1; // Return the current node as the next node in the merged list
  } else {
    list2.next = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2.next); // Merge list1 with the rest of list2
    return list2; // Return the current node as the next node in the merged list
  }
};
```

### **Explanation of the Recursive Approach**

1. **Base Cases:**
   - The recursion ends when one of the lists becomes empty (`null`). At that point, we return the non-empty list, which becomes the remainder of the merged list.
   - If `list1` is `null`, we return `list2` because there’s nothing left to merge from `list1`.
   - If `list2` is `null`, we return `list1` for the same reason.
2. **Recursive Case:**
   - At each step, we compare the values of the current nodes of `list1` and `list2`.
   - If `list1.val < list2.val`, then `list1`’s current node should be part of the merged list. We recursively merge the rest of `list1` (i.e., `list1.next`) with `list2` and set the result as the next node of `list1`.
   - Conversely, if `list2.val <= list1.val`, then `list2`’s current node should be part of the merged list. We recursively merge `list1` with the rest of `list2` (i.e., `list2.next`) and set the result as the next node of `list2`.
3. **Return Value:**
   - After comparing and linking the nodes, the current node (either from `list1` or `list2`) is returned as part of the merged list.
   - This process continues recursively until all nodes are merged.

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity remains \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n + m)\) due to the call stack. For each recursive call, a new frame is added to the stack, so the maximum depth of recursion corresponds to the total number of nodes in the lists. This is a key difference from the iterative approach, which has \(O(1)\) space complexity.
