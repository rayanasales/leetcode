## Problem Overview

You're given an array and a function `fn`. Your task is to return a sorted version of the array based on the results returned by `fn` when applied to each element. It might sound complex, but it’s actually quite simple!

## Solution

```Javascript []
var sortBy = function (arr, fn) {
  return arr.sort((a, b) => fn(a) - fn(b));
};
```

## Explanation

1. Function Definition: `sortBy` takes two parameters: `arr` (the array to be sorted) and `fn` (a function that extracts the sorting key from each element).

2. The Sort Method: `arr.sort((a, b) => fn(a) - fn(b))` is where the magic happens. This uses JavaScript’s built-in `sort()` method.
   - How `sort()` Works: The `sort()` method orders elements of an array according to the return value of the function passed to it, which in this case is `(a, b) => fn(a) - fn(b)`.
   - Sorting Criteria: The function `(a, b) => fn(a) - fn(b)` compares two elements, `a` and `b`, based on the values returned by applying `fn` to each. If `fn(a)` is less than `fn(b)`, `a` comes before `b` in the sorted array, and vice versa.

## Examples

1. Simple Numbers:

   ```javascript []
   console.log(sortBy([5, 1, 4, 2, 3], (x) => x)); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

   - `fn` is the identity function here, meaning elements are sorted by their actual values.

2. Sorting Objects:

   ```javascript []
   console.log(sortBy([{ x: 2 }, { x: 3 }, { x: 1 }], (obj) => obj.x)); // Outputs: [{x: 1}, {x: 2}, {x: 3}]
   ```

   - `fn` extracts the value of `x` from each object, sorting the array by these values.

3. Complex Arrays:
   ```javascript []
   console.log(
     sortBy(
       [
         [3, 4],
         [5, 2],
         [10, 11],
       ],
       (item) => item[1]
     )
   ); // Outputs: [[5, 2], [3, 4], [10, 11]]
   ```
   - `fn` takes the second element of each sub-array as the key for sorting.
