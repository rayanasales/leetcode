## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var mostWordsFound = function (sentences) {
  let maximumNumberOfWords = 0;
  for (let sentence of sentences) {
    let words = sentence.split(" ").length;
    maximumNumberOfWords = Math.max(words, maximumNumberOfWords);
  }
  return maximumNumberOfWords;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

This solution approaches the problem by iterating through each sentence in the `sentences` array to find the maximum number of words in any sentence. The steps are as follows:

1. Initialize a Variable for the Maximum Count: We begin with `maximumNumberOfWords` set to zero. This will store the maximum word count found across all sentences.

2. Loop Through Each Sentence: Using a `for` loop, each sentence is examined individually. For each sentence:

   - Count Words: The sentence is split by spaces (`" "`) to separate the words. Each sentence becomes an array of words, and the length of this array represents the word count of that sentence.
   - Update Maximum Count: We use `Math.max()` to compare the current sentence's word count with the highest count found so far. If the current sentence has more words, `maximumNumberOfWords` is updated.

3. Return the Result: After looping through all sentences, `maximumNumberOfWords` contains the maximum word count found in a single sentence, which is returned as the result.

This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging JavaScript’s `split()` function to break down sentences and `Math.max()` for comparing counts. It ensures that we only store the maximum word count rather than needing extra space for intermediate results.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s debug each input sentence step-by-step to see how the solution calculates the maximum word count.

- Example Input: `["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]`

  - First Sentence: `"alice and bob love leetcode"`
    - Word Count = `5`
    - `maximumNumberOfWords` is updated to `5`
  - Second Sentence: `"i think so too"`
    - Word Count = `4`
    - `maximumNumberOfWords` remains `5` (since `4 < 5`)
  - Third Sentence: `"this is great thanks very much"`
    - Word Count = `6`
    - `maximumNumberOfWords` is updated to `6`
  - Final Result: `6`

- Example Input: `["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]`
  - First Sentence: `"please wait"`
    - Word Count = `2`
    - `maximumNumberOfWords` is updated to `2`
  - Second Sentence: `"continue to fight"`
    - Word Count = `3`
    - `maximumNumberOfWords` is updated to `3`
  - Third Sentence: `"continue to win"`
    - Word Count = `3`
    - `maximumNumberOfWords` remains `3`
  - Final Result: `3`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of sentences in the input array. For each sentence, we use `split()`, which takes `O(m)` time, where `m` is the length of the sentence. However, as the sentence length has an upper limit (`100`), the overall complexity remains linear in relation to `n`.

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, as we are only using a constant amount of extra space (`maximumNumberOfWords`) to store the maximum count. The split arrays for each sentence are temporary and do not add to the total space complexity.
