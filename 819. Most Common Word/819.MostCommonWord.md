## 🌎 **Strategy**

The goal of this challenge is to find the **most common word** in a `paragraph` that is **not banned**. The `paragraph` can contain punctuation and uppercase/lowercase letters, but the search for the most frequent word should be case-insensitive, and punctuation should be ignored.

### **Steps:**

1. **Preprocess the Paragraph:**

   - Convert the `paragraph` to lowercase so that comparisons are case-insensitive.
   - Remove all punctuation, as the words should be treated as continuous text.
   - Split the `paragraph` into an array of words.

2. **Use a Set for Banned Words:**

   - Convert the list of `banned` words into a `Set`. This allows us to perform fast lookups (O(1) complexity) when checking if a word is banned.

3. **Count Word Frequencies:**
   - Use a `Map` to store the frequencies of each word.
   - For every word in the preprocessed `paragraph` that is not banned, update its count in the `Map`.
4. **Track the Most Common Non-Banned Word:**
   - As we count the occurrences of each word, keep track of the word with the highest frequency. This avoids the need for a second iteration to find the most frequent word.

### **Plan for Optimization**

- **O(n) time complexity:**  
  To achieve O(n), we avoid nested loops or multiple passes over the paragraph. Instead, we preprocess the paragraph in one pass, use a `Map` for counting frequencies, and a `Set` for banned words for fast lookups.
- **Efficient space usage:**  
  The `Map` only stores non-banned words, and the `Set` for banned words reduces unnecessary checks. These data structures ensure optimal performance for both time and space.

## 🚀 **Code Solution**

Here’s the optimized solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
var mostCommonWord = function (paragraph, banned) {
  // Create a set for banned words for faster lookup
  let bannedSet = new Set(banned);

  // Preprocess paragraph: remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and split into words
  let words = paragraph
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[!?',;.\s]+/g, " ")
    .split(" ");

  // Create a map to store the frequency of each word
  let occurrencesMap = new Map();
  let maxCount = 0;
  let mostCommon = "";

  // Count occurrences of non-banned words
  for (let word of words) {
    if (word && !bannedSet.has(word)) {
      // Ignore empty strings and banned words
      occurrencesMap.set(word, (occurrencesMap.get(word) || 0) + 1);

      // Track the most common word
      if (occurrencesMap.get(word) > maxCount) {
        maxCount = occurrencesMap.get(word);
        mostCommon = word;
      }
    }
  }

  return mostCommon;
};
```

## 🔎 **Step-by-Step Debugging**

Let’s debug the code using the following examples:

### **Test Case 1:**

```js
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.";
banned = ["hit"];
```

**Step 1: Preprocessing the paragraph**

- Convert to lowercase and remove punctuation:
  ```
  "bob hit a ball the hit ball flew far after it was hit"
  ```

**Step 2: Split into words**

```
["bob", "hit", "a", "ball", "the", "hit", "ball", "flew", "far", "after", "it", "was", "hit"]
```

**Step 3: Filter out banned words and count occurrences**

- Words counted (ignoring "hit" from banned list):
  - `"bob": 1`
  - `"a": 1`
  - `"ball": 2`
  - `"the": 1`
  - `"flew": 1`
  - `"far": 1`
  - `"after": 1`
  - `"it": 1`
  - `"was": 1`

**Step 4: Find the most common non-banned word**

- The word `"ball"` has the highest occurrence (2 times).
- **Output:** `"ball"`

### **Test Case 2:**

```js
paragraph = "a.";
banned = [];
```

**Step 1: Preprocessing the paragraph**

- Convert to lowercase and remove punctuation:
  ```
  "a"
  ```

**Step 2: Split into words**

```
["a"]
```

**Step 3: Filter out banned words and count occurrences**

- Word counted:
  - `"a": 1`

**Step 4: Find the most common non-banned word**

- The word `"a"` is the only word.
- **Output:** `"a"`

## 📊 **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

### **Time Complexity:**

- **Preprocessing the paragraph:**  
  Lowercasing, removing punctuation, and splitting the paragraph take **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `paragraph`.

- **Counting word frequencies:**  
  We iterate over all words once and insert them into the `Map`. Insertion into a `Map` is O(1), so this step is **O(n)**.

- **Checking banned words:**  
  Each lookup in the `Set` is O(1), and since this happens for each word, the overall time complexity for this step is also **O(n)**.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `paragraph`.

### **Space Complexity:**

- **The `Map` for word frequencies and `Set` for banned words:**  
  The space used by the `Map` is proportional to the number of unique words in the `paragraph`, and the `Set` space is proportional to the number of banned words.

Thus, the space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of unique words in the paragraph.
