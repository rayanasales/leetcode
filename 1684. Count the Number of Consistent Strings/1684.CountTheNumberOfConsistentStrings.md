## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var countConsistentStrings = function (allowed, words) {
  let counter = words.length;
  const allowedSet = new Set(allowed);

  for (const word of words) {
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!allowedSet.has(char)) {
        counter--;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return counter;
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. Initialize `counter`: Set `counter` to the length of `words`, assuming all words are initially consistent.
2. Convert `allowed` to a Set: Use a `Set` to store characters from `allowed`, enabling `O(1)` lookups to check if a character is allowed.
3. Loop Through Each Word: For each word in `words`, iterate through its characters.
4. Check Each Character: If any character in a word is not in `allowedSet`, we mark the word as inconsistent by decrementing `counter` and breaking out of the inner loop.
5. Return the Result: After examining all words, `counter` will contain the number of consistent words.

## 💎 Strategy

The core of this problem is to determine if each word in `words` is “consistent,” meaning all its characters exist in the string `allowed`. The strategy here uses two main optimizations:

1. Set for Allowed Characters: Instead of repeatedly checking each character in `allowed`, we convert `allowed` into a `Set`. This makes checking each character’s membership an `O(1)` operation, which is crucial for achieving `O(n)` complexity.

2. Early Exit on Inconsistency: As soon as we find a character in a word that is not in `allowedSet`, we immediately mark that word as inconsistent by decrementing `counter` and breaking out of the loop. This avoids unnecessary checks for remaining characters in the word, saving time.

This combination of a `Set` and early exits ensures the solution is optimized for both runtime and memory usage, maintaining an overall O(n) complexity.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let's go through each example step-by-step to understand how the code works:

### Example 1: `allowed = "ab"`, `words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]`

1. Initialize `counter = 5` (since `words` has 5 elements).
2. Convert `allowed` to `allowedSet = {'a', 'b'}`.
3. Process Each Word:
   - "ad": Character `d` is not in `allowedSet`, so decrement `counter` to `4`.
   - "bd": Character `d` is not in `allowedSet`, so decrement `counter` to `3`.
   - "aaab": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `3`.
   - "baa": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `3`.
   - "badab": Character `d` is not in `allowedSet`, so decrement `counter` to `2`.
4. Result: `counter` is `2`, indicating two consistent words.

### Example 2: `allowed = "abc"`, `words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]`

1. Initialize `counter = 7` (since `words` has 7 elements).
2. Convert `allowed` to `allowedSet = {'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
3. Process Each Word:
   - "a": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `7`.
   - "b": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `7`.
   - "c": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `7`.
   - "ab": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `7`.
   - "ac": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `7`.
   - "bc": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `7`.
   - "abc": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `7`.
4. Result: `counter` is `7`, indicating all words are consistent.

### Example 3: `allowed = "cad"`, `words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]`

1. Initialize `counter = 8` (since `words` has 8 elements).
2. Convert `allowed` to `allowedSet = {'c', 'a', 'd'}`.
3. Process Each Word:
   - "cc": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `8`.
   - "acd": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `8`.
   - "b": Character `b` is not in `allowedSet`, so decrement `counter` to `7`.
   - "ba": Character `b` is not in `allowedSet`, so decrement `counter` to `6`.
   - "bac": Character `b` is not in `allowedSet`, so decrement `counter` to `5`.
   - "bad": Character `b` is not in `allowedSet`, so decrement `counter` to `4`.
   - "ac": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `4`.
   - "d": All characters are in `allowedSet`, so `counter` remains `4`.
4. Result: `counter` is `4`, indicating four consistent words.
