## Background: everything you need to know

To solve the problem and achieve the goal of **Runtime 0ms** and **Beats 100%**, you need to approach the problem in a way that uses **constant space (O(1))** and **linear time complexity (O(n))**. The most efficient way to do this is to use the **XOR bitwise operation**, which works perfectly for this problem because of the properties of XOR.

### XOR Properties:

1. `a ^ a = 0` – Any number XORed with itself is 0.
2. `a ^ 0 = a` – Any number XORed with 0 is the number itself.
3. XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations doesn't matter.

By using XOR, we can "cancel out" all the numbers that appear twice, and the result will be the number that appears only once.

No, the `^` symbol in programming languages like JavaScript does **not** represent exponentiation (like `Math.pow(x, y)` which calculates x raised to the power of y). Instead, `^` is the **bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)** operator.

### What is XOR (`^`)?

XOR is a **bitwise operation**, meaning it works on the binary (bit) representation of numbers. It compares the bits of two numbers and outputs a new number where:

- The result is `1` if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are **different**.
- The result is `0` if the corresponding bits are **the same**.

In simpler terms:

- **1 XOR 1 = 0**
- **0 XOR 0 = 0**
- **1 XOR 0 = 1**
- **0 XOR 1 = 1**

The XOR operation is performed bit by bit on the binary representations of the numbers.

### Example of XOR:

Let’s look at an example using the numbers 4 and 3.

#### Binary representation:

- `4` in binary is `100`
- `3` in binary is `011`

Now, applying the XOR operation bit by bit:

```
  100   (4 in binary)
^ 011   (3 in binary)
-------
  111   (Result is 7 in decimal)
```

So, `4 ^ 3 = 7`.

This is not exponentiation. Instead, it's comparing each bit of the two numbers and producing a new binary number based on the XOR rules.

### To Summarize:

- The `^` operator performs a **bitwise XOR**, not exponentiation.
- XOR compares the bits of two numbers and returns `1` where the bits differ, and `0` where they are the same.
- This property is useful in problems like the LeetCode question because it allows us to "cancel out" numbers that appear in pairs, leaving only the unique number.

## Solution

```javascript []
var singleNumber = function (nums) {
  // Initialize a variable to store the result
  let result = 0;

  // XOR every number in the array
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    result ^= nums[i];
  }

  // The result will hold the single number
  return result;
};
```

```Java []
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize a variable to store the result
        int result = 0;

        // XOR every number in the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            result ^= nums[i]; // Apply XOR operation
        }

        // The result will hold the single number
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We start with a variable `result` initialized to 0.
2. **XOR Operation**: We iterate over the array `nums`. For each element, we perform XOR between `result` and the current element `nums[i]`. Due to the XOR properties:
   - Numbers that appear twice will cancel each other out because `n ^ n = 0`.
   - The number that appears only once will be the final result after all XOR operations.
3. **Return**: After the loop, `result` will hold the value of the single number.

In our problem, XOR helps identify the unique number in an array of pairs. Here's why:

- If you XOR a number with itself, you get 0 (`a ^ a = 0`).
- XORing a number with 0 leaves the number unchanged (`a ^ 0 = a`).
- XOR is both commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations doesn't matter.

Therefore, when you XOR all the numbers in the array, the pairs will cancel each other out (because `n ^ n = 0` for any number `n`), and only the unique number (which appears once) will be left.

## Step-by-Step Debugging

### Input array: `[2, 2, 1]`

1. Start with `result = 0`.
2. XOR with 2: `0 ^ 2 = 2`.
3. XOR with 2 again: `2 ^ 2 = 0`.
4. XOR with 1: `0 ^ 1 = 1`.

At the end, the result is `1`, which is the number that appears only once.

### Input array: `[1]`

1. Start with `result = 0`.
2. XOR with 1: `0 ^ 1 = 1`.

At the end, the result is `1`, which is the number that appears only once.

### Input array: `[4, 1, 2, 1, 2]`

1. Start with `result = 0`.
2. XOR with 4: `0 ^ 4 = 4`.
3. XOR with 1: `4 ^ 1 = 5`.
4. XOR with 2: `5 ^ 2 = 7`.
5. XOR with 1 again: `7 ^ 1 = 6`.
6. XOR with 2 again: `6 ^ 2 = 4`.

At the end, the result is `4`, which is the number that appears only once.
