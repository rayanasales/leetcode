## Solution in javascript

```javascript
var createCounter = function (n) {
  return function () {
    return n++;
  };
};
```

## Explanation

This code defines a function `createCounter` that takes an initial value `n` and returns another function. Each time the returned function is called, it increments `n` and returns the new value. This is a simple closure that maintains the state of `n` across multiple calls.
