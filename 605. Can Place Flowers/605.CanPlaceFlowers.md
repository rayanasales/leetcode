## 🌎 Strategy

In this problem, the goal is to determine if we can plant a given number of flowers (`n`) in a flowerbed array (`flowerbed`) without violating the rule that flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. The `flowerbed` array contains `0` (representing an empty plot) and `1` (representing an already occupied plot).

### Plan for Optimization

1. Linear Traverse: We need to traverse the flowerbed array only once, keeping the operations as minimal as possible. This ensures an O(n) time complexity.
2. Conditions for Planting: The key condition is that we can only plant a flower in an empty plot (i.e., a `0`) if both its left and right neighbors are also empty (or if it’s the edge of the flowerbed).
3. Early Exit: If we can plant the required number of flowers (`n`) during traversal, we can return `true` immediately without further checking.
4. Edge Handling: Special attention is needed for the first and last plot, where there might not be a left or right neighbor, respectively.

## 🚀 Commented Solution

```javascript []
var canPlaceFlowers = function (flowerbed, n) {
  let count = 0; // Initialize counter to track planted flowers
  for (let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
    // Check if the current plot is empty, the left neighbor (if any) is empty or the edge,
    // and the right neighbor (if any) is empty or the edge.
    if (
      flowerbed[i] === 0 &&
      (i === 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] === 0) &&
      (i === flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] === 0)
    ) {
      flowerbed[i] = 1; // Plant the flower by marking the current plot as 1
      count++; // Increment the count of planted flowers
      if (count >= n) return true; // If we've planted enough flowers, return true
    }
  }
  // After traversing the entire flowerbed, check if we've planted enough flowers
  return count >= n;
};
```

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

### Example 1:

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

Step-by-Step:

1. `i = 0`: flowerbed[0] is `1` (already planted), so we move to the next plot.
2. `i = 1`: flowerbed[1] is `0`, check the left and right neighbors (flowerbed[0] is `1` and flowerbed[2] is `0`), so no planting is possible.
3. `i = 2`: flowerbed[2] is `0`, check the left and right neighbors (flowerbed[1] is `0` and flowerbed[3] is `0`). Both are empty, so we plant a flower here (mark flowerbed[2] as `1`). Increment `count` to 1.
4. Since `count = 1` matches `n = 1`, we return `true`.

### Example 2:

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

Step-by-Step:

1. `i = 0`: flowerbed[0] is `1`, so no planting.
2. `i = 1`: flowerbed[1] is `0`, but the left neighbor is `1`, so no planting.
3. `i = 2`: flowerbed[2] is `0`, and both neighbors are `0`, so we plant a flower here (mark flowerbed[2] as `1`). Increment `count` to 1.
4. `i = 3`: flowerbed[3] is `0`, but the right neighbor is `1`, so no planting.
5. After traversing the entire flowerbed, `count = 1` which is less than `n = 2`, so we return `false`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity:  
  The time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the length of the `flowerbed` array. We only traverse the array once and perform constant-time checks at each index.

- Space Complexity:  
  The space complexity is O(1) because we are modifying the flowerbed array in place and only using a few additional variables (`count` and `i`).
