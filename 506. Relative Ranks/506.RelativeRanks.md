## 🔦 Problem Overview

You are given an array `score` that contains the scores of athletes in a competition. The goal is to determine the ranking of each athlete based on their score. You must return a list where each element corresponds to the rank of the athlete with that score.

##### How Rankings Are Determined:

1. Identify the Top 3 Athletes:

   - The athlete with the highest score gets the `"Gold Medal"`.
   - The athlete with the second highest score gets the `"Silver Medal"`.
   - The athlete with the third highest score gets the `"Bronze Medal"`.

2. Ranks for the Rest of the Athletes:
   - From the 4th athlete onward, instead of medals, they receive their numerical placement. For example, the athlete with the 4th highest score gets the rank `"4"`, the one with the 5th highest score gets `"5"`, and so on.

##### How to Calculate the Output:

1. Sort the scores in descending order to figure out the rankings.
2. Map each score to its corresponding rank:
   - The highest score gets `"Gold Medal"`,
   - The second highest gets `"Silver Medal"`,
   - The third highest gets `"Bronze Medal"`,
   - The remaining athletes get their rank as a number.
3. Return the ranks in the original order of the input scores.

## 🌎 Strategy to solve the problem avoiding expensive operations

This approach efficiently solves the Relative Ranks problem by avoiding redundant operations such as repeatedly searching for maximum values. Instead, we leverage the concept of index mapping after sorting the scores, which significantly reduces the number of operations and speeds up the algorithm.

### Key Insights:

1. Mapping Scores to Their Indices:
   - We create a sorted list of indices based on the athletes' scores. This ensures that we avoid calling `Math.max()` multiple times, which would otherwise slow down the solution.
2. Efficient Rank Assignment:
   - We use a simple loop to assign the ranks. By utilizing the sorted indices, we directly place the rank in the correct position in the output array, ensuring both speed and minimal memory overhead.
3. Memory Efficiency:
   - The solution does not create multiple auxiliary arrays and only uses an index-based mapping, reducing the memory footprint.

By avoiding expensive operations (like multiple maximum lookups or string manipulations) and relying on index sorting combined with a direct assignment of medals, this solution achieves the optimal O(n log n) time complexity for sorting while keeping memory usage minimal.

## 🚀 Commented Solution (Beats 100% 🏎️💨🏁🏆)

```javascript []
var findRelativeRanks = function (score) {
  // Get the number of athletes
  const n = score.length;

  // Initialize an empty array to store the ranks
  const output = new Array(n);

  // Create an array of indices and sort them by the scores in descending order
  const sortedIndices = score
    .map((s, i) => i)
    .sort((a, b) => score[b] - score[a]);

  // Loop through the sorted indices and assign ranks based on the index position
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const rank = i + 1; // Rank is the position in the sorted order (1-based index)

    // Assign the appropriate medal or rank to the corresponding athlete's index
    if (rank === 1) output[sortedIndices[i]] = "Gold Medal";
    else if (rank === 2) output[sortedIndices[i]] = "Silver Medal";
    else if (rank === 3) output[sortedIndices[i]] = "Bronze Medal";
    else output[sortedIndices[i]] = rank.toString();
  }

  // Return the result array containing the ranks in the original order of scores
  return output;
};
```

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Input: `score = [10, 3, 8, 9, 4]`

1. Step 1: Mapping and Sorting Indices:

   - Initial mapping: `[(10, 0), (3, 1), (8, 2), (9, 3), (4, 4)]`
   - Sorted indices by descending scores: `[0, 3, 2, 4, 1]`
     - Index 0 corresponds to score 10 (1st place)
     - Index 3 corresponds to score 9 (2nd place)
     - Index 2 corresponds to score 8 (3rd place)
     - Index 4 corresponds to score 4 (4th place)
     - Index 1 corresponds to score 3 (5th place)

2. Step 2: Assigning ranks:

   - i = 0: Rank 1 → "Gold Medal" → Athlete at index 0 (score 10) gets "Gold Medal".
   - i = 1: Rank 2 → "Silver Medal" → Athlete at index 3 (score 9) gets "Silver Medal".
   - i = 2: Rank 3 → "Bronze Medal" → Athlete at index 2 (score 8) gets "Bronze Medal".
   - i = 3: Rank 4 → "4" → Athlete at index 4 (score 4) gets "4".
   - i = 4: Rank 5 → "5" → Athlete at index 1 (score 3) gets "5".

3. Final Output: `["Gold Medal", "5", "Bronze Medal", "Silver Medal", "4"]`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- Sorting the indices of the array takes O(n log n) where n is the number of athletes. This dominates the overall time complexity.
- The rest of the operations (mapping, assigning ranks) are O(n), which is linear.
- Total Time Complexity: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity:

- We use O(n) additional space for:
  - The `output` array, which stores the ranks for each athlete.
  - The `sortedIndices` array, which stores the sorted indices based on scores.
- Total Space Complexity: O(n)

### Why is this solution optimal?

- Sorting in O(n log n) is the fastest we can get for sorting problems, and the rank assignment process is done in a single loop of O(n).
- The solution uses minimal additional memory by only storing indices and ranks.
