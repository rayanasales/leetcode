## 🌎 Strategy

The problem asks us to rearrange an array such that even-indexed positions hold even numbers and odd-indexed positions hold odd numbers. The array is guaranteed to have half even and half odd numbers.

To achieve this in **O(n)** time complexity and **O(1)** space complexity, we use a **two-pointer technique**:

1. We create two pointers:
   - One pointer (`i`) starts from index 0 and moves through the even indices.
   - Another pointer (`j`) starts from index 1 and moves through the odd indices.
2. As we iterate:
   - If `nums[i]` (an even index) contains an odd number and `nums[j]` (an odd index) contains an even number, we swap them.
   - After every check, the pointers only move if the numbers at their respective indices are correctly placed. This helps minimize unnecessary operations.
3. We repeat this process until both pointers finish traversing the array.

### Plan for Optimization

- **Minimize checks:** Only increment pointers when the values at `i` and `j` are correct (i.e., even numbers at even indices and odd numbers at odd indices).
- **Swap without using extra space:** Use a well-known arithmetic swap trick to avoid using a temporary variable, which slightly optimizes performance.
- **Reduce unnecessary operations:** The loop iterates through the array only once, ensuring we achieve O(n) time complexity.

This ensures that the solution is both **time-efficient** and **space-efficient** while keeping the logic straightforward.

## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript
var sortArrayByParityII = function (nums) {
  let i = 0; // even index pointer
  let j = 1; // odd index pointer
  let n = nums.length;

  while (i < n && j < n) {
    // If number at even index i is odd, and number at odd index j is even, swap them
    if (nums[i] % 2 !== 0 && nums[j] % 2 === 0) {
      // Swap the elements directly without temporary variable to reduce operations
      nums[i] = nums[i] + nums[j];
      nums[j] = nums[i] - nums[j];
      nums[i] = nums[i] - nums[j];
    }

    // Increment i only if nums[i] is correctly placed (i.e., it's even)
    if (nums[i] % 2 === 0) i += 2;

    // Increment j only if nums[j] is correctly placed (i.e., it's odd)
    if (nums[j] % 2 !== 0) j += 2;
  }

  return nums;
};
```

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s debug the solution using some sample input entries to understand how the algorithm works.

### Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [4, 2, 5, 7]
```

1. Initially, `i = 0`, `j = 1`, and `nums = [4, 2, 5, 7]`.
2. Check `nums[0]`, which is `4` (even number at an even index). It’s correct, so move `i` to 2.
3. Check `nums[2]`, which is `5` (odd number at an even index). This is incorrect.
4. Check `nums[1]`, which is `2` (even number at an odd index). This is incorrect.
5. Swap `nums[2]` and `nums[1]`. Now the array becomes: `[4, 5, 2, 7]`.
6. Increment `i` to 4 and `j` to 3. Both are out of bounds, so the loop terminates.
7. Final output: `[4, 5, 2, 7]`

### Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 4, 1, 2]
```

1. Initially, `i = 0`, `j = 1`, and `nums = [3, 4, 1, 2]`.
2. Check `nums[0]`, which is `3` (odd number at an even index). This is incorrect.
3. Check `nums[1]`, which is `4` (even number at an odd index). This is incorrect.
4. Swap `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`. Now the array becomes: `[4, 3, 1, 2]`.
5. Increment `i` to 2 and `j` to 3.
6. Check `nums[2]`, which is `1` (odd number at an even index). This is incorrect.
7. Check `nums[3]`, which is `2` (even number at an odd index). This is incorrect.
8. Swap `nums[2]` and `nums[3]`. Now the array becomes: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
9. Increment `i` to 4 and `j` to 5. Both are out of bounds, so the loop terminates.
10. Final output: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`

### Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [2, 3]
```

1. Initially, `i = 0`, `j = 1`, and `nums = [2, 3]`.
2. Check `nums[0]`, which is `2` (even number at an even index). It’s correct, so move `i` to 2.
3. Check `nums[1]`, which is `3` (odd number at an odd index). It’s correct, so move `j` to 3.
4. Both `i` and `j` are out of bounds. The loop terminates.
5. Final output: `[2, 3]`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**:
  - We traverse through the array exactly once. Each element is processed at most twice (once by `i` and once by `j`), which ensures the time complexity is linear in the size of the input array.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(1)**:
  - The sorting is done in-place, meaning no additional space is required. We use only a fixed number of variables (`i`, `j`, `n`), which doesn't depend on the input size.
