## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var decodeMessage = function (key, message) {
  key = Array.from(new Set(key.split(" ").join("")));
  const alpha = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
  const hash = new Map();
  let result = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < alpha.length; i++) hash.set(key[i], alpha[i]);
  for (let chr of message) result += hash.get(chr) || " ";
  return result;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy Explained

This solution involves creating a substitution cipher from a given `key` string to decode a `message`. The process is outlined step-by-step below:

1. Clean and Extract Unique Characters: The `key` is transformed by removing spaces with `key.split(' ').join('')` and converting it into a set to remove duplicates, then back to an array. This ensures each character from 'a' to 'z' appears only once and in the order of their first occurrence.

2. Mapping Creation: The English alphabet is stored in `alpha`. A map (`hash`) is created where each character from the cleaned `key` corresponds to a letter in the standard English alphabet in order. This mapping is essential for the substitution cipher.

3. Decoding: The message is iterated character by character. Each character is replaced by its corresponding letter from the `hash`. If the character is a space (' '), it is directly appended as a space in the result.

This method ensures that each letter in the message is substituted according to the first unique occurrences of letters in the `key`.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s apply the provided function to the examples:

### Example 1:

- Key: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
- Message: "vkbs bs t suepuv"
- Expected Output: "this is a secret"

Process:

1. Clean Key: Resulting key from `Array.from(new Set(key.split(' ').join('')))`: "thequickbrownfxjmpsvlazydg"
2. Mapping: Corresponding to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
3. Decode:
   - `v` -> `t`
   - `k` -> `h`
   - `b` -> `i`
   - `s` -> `s` and so on...
   - Final Decoded Message: "this is a secret"

### Example 2:

- Key: "eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo"
- Message: "zwx hnf x lqantp mnoeius ycgk vcjnr db"
- Expected Output: "the five boxing wizards jump quickly"

Process:

1. Clean Key: Already unique and complete.
2. Mapping: Directly "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
3. Decode:
   - `z` -> `t`
   - `w` -> `h`
   - `x` -> `e` and so on...
   - Final Decoded Message: "the five boxing wizards jump quickly"

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the `key` and `m` is the length of the `message`. Creating the set and map from the key is O(n), and decoding the message is O(m).

Space Complexity: O(1). Despite inputs, the space required for the map (`hash`) is constant because it contains at most 26 key-value pairs, one for each letter of the alphabet.

This solution efficiently decodes messages using a substitution cipher based on a unique mapping derived from the key, ensuring robust and quick translation for any valid input.
