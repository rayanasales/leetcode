## Solution

```Javascript []
Array.prototype.snail = function (rowsCount, colsCount) {
  if (rowsCount * colsCount !== this.length) return [];

  let output = new Array(rowsCount).fill().map(() => new Array(colsCount));
  let index = 0; // Index in the original array
  let i = 0,
    j = 0; // Indices for positions in the output matrix
  let direction = "down"; // Initial filling direction

  while (index < this.length) {
    output[i][j] = this[index++]; // Assign the current value and increment the index

    if (direction === "down") {
      if (i === rowsCount - 1) {
        // Check if it should change column
        direction = "up"; // Change direction
        j++; // Move to the next column
      } else {
        i++; // Continue going down in the same column
      }
    } else if (direction === "up") {
      if (i === 0) {
        // Check if it is at the top
        direction = "down"; // Change direction
        j++; // Move to the next column
      } else {
        i--; // Continue going up in the same column
      }
    }
  }

  return output;
};
```

## Explanation

### **Step-by-Step Algorithm Description:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function is called on an array with specific dimensions (`rowsCount` and `colsCount`) that the matrix should have.
   - Check if the total number of elements (`rowsCount * colsCount`) matches the length of the original array. If not, return an empty array since it's not possible to fill the matrix correctly.
2. **Matrix Setup:**
   - Create an empty matrix called `output` of the specified dimensions. This matrix starts filled with undefined values that will be replaced with elements from the original array.
3. **Traversal and Filling:**
   - Use a `while` loop to traverse the original array and fill the matrix.
   - Maintain a `direction` variable that toggles between "down" and "up" to control the traversal direction of filling the matrix.
   - Use two indices, `i` and `j`, to represent the current position in the matrix where the next element from the array will be placed.
4. **Direction Control:**
   - When moving "down," if the bottom of the current column is reached, switch direction to "up" and proceed to the next column.
   - When moving "up," if the top of the column is reached, switch direction to "down" and proceed to the next column.
   - This zigzag pattern continues until all elements from the original array are placed in the matrix.
5. **Completion:**
   - The loop exits once all elements are placed, and the fully populated matrix is returned.

This approach effectively maps a linear array into a 2D matrix following a snail or spiral pattern, making sure every element is placed in a specified sequence without overwriting or missing any positions.
