## Solution in javascript

```js
var reduce = function (nums, fn, init) {
  if (nums.length === 0) {
    return init;
  }

  return nums.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
    return fn(accumulator, currentValue);
  }, init); // initial value of accumulator
};
```

## Explanation:

This code provides a simple approach to reduce an array of numbers using a provided function and an initial value. Here's how it works:

1. **Handling Empty Arrays:**
   - The function first checks if the nums array is empty. If it is, the function immediately returns the init value, as there are no elements to reduce.
2. **Using the reduce Method:**
   - If the array is not empty, the function uses the reduce method to process the array.
   - The reduce method takes a callback function and an initial value (init). The callback function is called for each element in the array, with the accumulator and the current value as arguments.
   - The callback function applies the provided fn to the accumulator and the current value, and the result becomes the new accumulator value for the next iteration.
3. **Returning the Result:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the reduce method returns the final accumulated value, which is then returned by the reduce function.
