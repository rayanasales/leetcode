## Solution in javascript

```js
var addBinary = function (a, b) {
  let result = "";
  let carry = 0;
  let i = a.length - 1;
  let j = b.length - 1;

  // Loop through both strings from the end to the beginning
  while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
    // Get the current digit from each string, or 0 if index is out of bounds
    let sum = carry;
    if (i >= 0) sum += a[i--] - "0";
    if (j >= 0) sum += b[j--] - "0";

    result = (sum % 2) + result; // Append the sum modulo 2 to the result (this is the current binary digit)
    carry = Math.floor(sum / 2); // Update carry for the next iteration
  }

  if (carry > 0) {
    result = "1" + result; // If there's a carry left after the last addition, append it
  }

  return result;
};
```

## Explanation

### **Initial Approach**

Initially, I attempted to solve the problem by converting the binary strings to decimal numbers, adding them together, and then converting the result back to a binary string. Here's the code I wrote:

```js
var addBinary = function (a, b) {
  // Convert binary strings to decimal numbers
  var dec = Number(parseInt(a, 2)) + Number(parseInt(b, 2));

  // Convert the sum back to a binary string
  return dec.toString(2);
};
```

### **Why It Didn't Work?**

**Precision Issues:** JavaScript's `Number` type is limited to 64-bit precision, which is not sufficient to handle very large numbers accurately, particularly those that can arise from binary strings of up to 10,000 characters in length. This limitation led to precision errors, causing incorrect outputs for large inputs.

To solve the problem efficiently and avoid precision errors, we need to implement a solution that manually performs binary addition, similar to how you would do it by hand.

### How to manually performs binary addition?

### Understanding Binary Numbers:

- **Binary numbers** consist only of the digits `0` and `1`.
- Each digit in a binary number represents an increasing power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit, which is the least significant bit (LSB).

### Binary Addition Rules:

There are four basic rules for adding binary digits (bits):

1. **0 + 0 = 0**
2. **0 + 1 = 1**
3. **1 + 0 = 1**
4. **1 + 1 = 10** (which is `0` with a carry of `1` to the next higher bit)

## Step-by-Step Example:

Let's add two binary numbers: `1010` and `1011`.

### 1. Align the Numbers:

First, write the two binary numbers one under the other, aligning them by the rightmost digits.

```
  1010
+ 1011
```

### 2. Start from the Rightmost Digit (Least Significant Bit):

- **Step 1:** Add the rightmost bits: `0 + 1 = 1`
  - No carry is generated, so write `1` under the line.

```
    1010
  + 1011
  ------
       1  (This is the sum for the rightmost bit)
```

- **Step 2:** Move one digit to the left: `1 + 1 = 10`
  - Here, `1 + 1` gives us `10` in binary, so write `0` and carry `1` to the next column.

```
    1010
  + 1011
  ------
      01  (This is the sum for the first two bits)
```

- **Step 3:** Move one more digit to the left, but don't forget to add the carry from the previous column: `0 + 0 + 1(carry) = 1`
  - There’s no new carry, so write `1`.

```
    1010
  + 1011
  ------
     101  (This is the sum for the first three bits)
```

- **Step 4:** Move to the leftmost bit: `1 + 1 = 10`
  - Again, `1 + 1` gives `10`, so write `0` and carry `1` to the next column.

```
    1010
  + 1011
  ------
    0101  (This is the sum for the leftmost bit)
   + 1    (This is the carry that needs to be added at the end)
```

### 3. Handle Any Remaining Carry:

Since there's a carry left after adding the leftmost bits, you write it down as the next higher bit:

```
    1010
  + 1011
  ------
   10101  (Final result)
```

So, `1010` + `1011` in binary equals `10101`.

### Summary of the Steps:

1. **Align the binary numbers** by their rightmost digits.
2. **Add the corresponding bits** starting from the rightmost bit, following the binary addition rules.
3. **Write the sum** for each column beneath the line.
4. If the sum in any column is `10` in binary, **write down `0`** and carry over `1` to the next column.
5. If there’s a carry left after adding the leftmost bits, **write it** as the next bit to the left.
6. The resulting string is your final binary sum.
