## Solution in javascript

```js
var isAnagram = function (s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

  sSorted = s.split("").sort().join("");
  tSorted = t.split("").sort().join("");

  return sSorted === tSorted;
};
```

## Explanation

This code provides a simple approach to determine if two strings are anagrams. Here's how it works:

1. Check Lengths:

- The function first checks if the lengths of the two strings s and t are different. If they are, it immediately returns false because strings of different lengths cannot be anagrams.

2. Sort and Compare:

- Both strings are split into arrays of characters, sorted, and then joined back into strings.
  The sorted versions of the strings are compared. If they are identical, the original strings are anagrams of each other, and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
