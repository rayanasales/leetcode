## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
class MyHashSet {
  constructor() {
    this.set = {};
  } // Initialize an empty object to store keys
  add(key) {
    this.set[key] = true;
  } // Set the key to true to mark its presence
  contains(key) {
    return this.set[key] === true;
  } // Return true if key is present, otherwise false
  remove(key) {
    delete this.set[key];
  } // Remove the key from the set if it exists
}

/**
 * Usage example:
 * var myHashSet = new MyHashSet();
 * myHashSet.add(1);       // Adds key 1
 * myHashSet.add(2);       // Adds key 2
 * console.log(myHashSet.contains(1));  // Returns true (1 is in the set)
 * console.log(myHashSet.contains(3));  // Returns false (3 is not in the set)
 * myHashSet.remove(2);    // Removes key 2
 * console.log(myHashSet.contains(2));  // Returns false (2 has been removed)

## 🌎 Strategy Explained

The approach for this `HashSet` implementation uses a JavaScript object (`{}`) to store keys. This is a clean and efficient solution that leverages the built-in behavior of JavaScript objects to emulate a set, without needing additional libraries or complex data structures.

1. Object as a HashSet: JavaScript objects allow for constant-time insertion, deletion, and lookup for keys. This makes them a natural fit for implementing a set, where we only care about the presence or absence of unique keys.
2. Key Operations:
   - `add(key)`: Adds a key to the set by setting `this.set[key] = true`. This ensures that each key is stored uniquely, and avoids duplicates automatically.
   - `contains(key)`: Checks if a key exists by returning `this.set[key] === true`. This checks if the key has been added to the set.
   - `remove(key)`: Removes a key from the set using `delete this.set[key]`, which deletes the key if it exists.

### Why This Approach Works

- Simplicity: This solution avoids the complexity of handling hash functions, bucket arrays, or collision resolution strategies. It simply uses JavaScript’s native object capabilities to provide O(1) operations.
- Efficiency: JavaScript objects are highly optimized for quick key lookups and deletions, making them a great choice for building a simple HashSet.

### Plan for Optimization

This solution is already very efficient, leveraging JavaScript's built-in object optimizations. However, here are a few potential areas of improvement:

- Memory Efficiency: In some cases, using a native `Set` object could offer slight improvements in memory management over the plain object, especially when dealing with very large datasets.
- Handling Special Cases: Although JavaScript handles large numbers well, we could optimize for specific edge cases, such as using a more efficient key-handling mechanism for very large numbers.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Input:

```js []
[
  "MyHashSet",
  "add",
  "add",
  "contains",
  "contains",
  "add",
  "contains",
  "remove",
  "contains",
][([], [1], [2], [1], [3], [2], [2], [2], [2])];
```

1. Step 1: `MyHashSet()`

   - Initializes an empty set: `{}`.

2. Step 2: `add(1)`

   - Adds key `1` to the set. Now the set looks like: `{ 1: true }`.

3. Step 3: `add(2)`

   - Adds key `2` to the set. Now the set looks like: `{ 1: true, 2: true }`.

4. Step 4: `contains(1)`

   - Checks if the key `1` exists in the set. The set contains `{ 1: true, 2: true }`.
   - The result is `true`.

5. Step 5: `contains(3)`

   - Checks if the key `3` exists in the set. Since it doesn’t, the result is `false`.

6. Step 6: `add(2)`

   - Adds key `2` again. Since `2` is already in the set, nothing changes. The set remains `{ 1: true, 2: true }`.

7. Step 7: `contains(2)`

   - Checks if the key `2` exists in the set. The result is `true`.

8. Step 8: `remove(2)`

   - Removes key `2` from the set. Now the set looks like: `{ 1: true }`.

9. Step 9: `contains(2)`
   - Checks if the key `2` exists in the set. Since it has been removed, the result is `false`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- `add(key)`:
  - Adding a key to a JavaScript object takes O(1) on average.
- `contains(key)`:

  - Checking if a key exists in a JavaScript object is an O(1) operation on average.

- `remove(key)`:
  - Removing a key from a JavaScript object is an O(1) operation on average.

Thus, all operations (`add`, `contains`, `remove`) are O(1) on average.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of unique keys stored in the set. This is because each key is stored as a property in the JavaScript object, taking up space proportional to the number of elements.

This solution is not only clean and intuitive but also highly efficient, achieving O(1) time complexity for all operations while using minimal space. This makes it an excellent choice for handling large datasets in a `HashSet` implementation.
