## 🛟 Background: first things first

We are implementing a hash set from scratch without using built-in hash table libraries. The goal of a hash set is to store unique elements, allowing for fast operations like adding elements, checking if an element exists, and removing elements.

To achieve this, we use the bucket-based hashing strategy.

### What is a bucket?

- A bucket is simply a collection (in this case, an array or list) where we store elements that share the same hash value. Since different elements can hash to the same index (this is called a collision), we need a way to handle multiple elements in one "slot" of our hash set. Each "slot" is called a bucket.

### Why do we need a bucket?

- We need a bucket to handle collisions. If two keys have the same hash value, they will be placed in the same bucket. The bucket helps to store and manage multiple keys that map to the same hash value. Instead of using a single variable, we use a collection (an array in this case) to handle this.

### What is `_getBucketIndex`?

- `_getBucketIndex` (or `_hash` in your code) is the function that computes the index for the bucket where a key should be stored. It is called a hash function. The function uses a modulus operation (`key % 769`) to determine the index of the bucket. The result of this operation is a number between `0` and `768`, which maps the key to a specific bucket.

  - Why the underscore (`_`) in the name?
    - The underscore is a common convention in programming to indicate that a method is private, meaning it’s not intended to be called from outside the class. In this case, `_hash` is a utility method used internally by the class to compute bucket indices, and the underscore reminds us that it's not part of the public API.

## 💎 Algorithm Explanation

1. Buckets Initialization:

   - We create an array of `769` buckets. Each bucket is an empty list (`[]`). The reason for choosing `769` is that it’s a prime number, which helps to reduce collisions. Prime numbers ensure that the keys are more evenly distributed across the buckets.

2. Adding a Key (`add`):

   - We use the hash function `_hash(key)` to compute which bucket the key should go into.
   - If the key is not already in the bucket (checked using `bucket.includes(key)`), we add it to that bucket using `bucket.push(key)`. This prevents duplicates from being added.

3. Removing a Key (`remove`):

   - We again compute the bucket index for the key using `_hash(key)`.
   - We find the index of the key in the bucket using `bucket.indexOf(key)`. If the key exists (`indexOf` returns a valid index), we remove it from the bucket using `bucket.splice(keyIndex, 1)`.

4. Checking if a Key Exists (`contains`):
   - We compute the bucket index using `_hash(key)` and then check if the bucket contains the key using `bucket.includes(key)`. This returns `true` if the key exists, otherwise `false`.

## ⚡️ Plan for Optimization

The current implementation is decent, but it can be optimized further to improve performance.

### Potential Optimizations:

1. Use a Set for Each Bucket:

   - Instead of using an array for each bucket, we can use a `Set`. A `Set` provides faster operations (`add`, `delete`, `has`) compared to an array because it avoids the need to check for duplicates with `includes` (which takes linear time).

2. Improve the Hash Function:
   - The current hash function is quite simple (`key % 769`). While this is fine for smaller datasets, for larger datasets we might need a more complex hash function to better distribute keys and reduce collisions. Using more advanced techniques like multiplicative hashing can improve key distribution.

## 🚀 Commented Solution

```javascript []
class MyHashSet {
  constructor() {
    // Initialize the hash set with an array of buckets.
    // Each bucket is an empty array (list) that will hold multiple keys in case of hash collisions.
    this.buckets = new Array(769); // 769 is a prime number to minimize collisions.

    // Initialize each bucket as an empty list (array).
    for (let i = 0; i < this.buckets.length; i++) {
      this.buckets[i] = [];
    }
  }

  // This function computes the bucket index for a given key.
  // It ensures that the key is mapped to an index between 0 and 768.
  _hash(key) {
    return key % 769;
  }

  /*
   * Adds the key to the hash set.
   * @param {number} key - The key to be added.
   */
  add(key) {
    // Get the bucket index for this key.
    const bucketIndex = this._hash(key);

    // Get the bucket (list of keys) at the computed index.
    const bucket = this.buckets[bucketIndex];

    // Only add the key if it's not already in the bucket.
    if (!bucket.includes(key)) {
      bucket.push(key);
    }
  }

  /*
   * Removes the key from the hash set.
   * @param {number} key - The key to be removed.
   */
  remove(key) {
    // Get the bucket index for this key.
    const bucketIndex = this._hash(key);

    // Get the bucket (list of keys) at the computed index.
    const bucket = this.buckets[bucketIndex];

    // Find the index of the key in the bucket.
    const keyIndex = bucket.indexOf(key);

    // If the key is found (index != -1), remove it from the bucket.
    if (keyIndex !== -1) {
      bucket.splice(keyIndex, 1);
    }
  }

  /*
   * Checks if the key exists in the hash set.
   * @param {number} key - The key to check for existence.
   * @return {boolean} - True if the key exists, false otherwise.
   */
  contains(key) {
    // Get the bucket index for this key.
    const bucketIndex = this._hash(key);

    // Get the bucket (list of keys) at the computed index.
    const bucket = this.buckets[bucketIndex];

    // Return true if the key is found in the bucket, false otherwise.
    return bucket.includes(key);
  }
}

/*
 * Usage:
 * var obj = new MyHashSet();
 * obj.add(key);
 * obj.remove(key);
 * var param_3 = obj.contains(key);
 */

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s debug the following inputs:

```
["MyHashSet", "add", "add", "contains", "contains", "add", "contains", "remove", "contains"]
[[], [1], [2], [1], [3], [2], [2], [2], [2]]
```

### Step 1: Instantiate `MyHashSet`.

```javascript []
var obj = new MyHashSet();
```

- This creates the hash set with 769 empty buckets.

### Step 2: `add(1)`

```javascript []
obj.add(1);
```

- The `_hash(1)` function returns `1 % 769 = 1`. So, the key `1` is added to the bucket at index `1`.
- Now, the bucket at index `1` contains `[1]`.

### Step 3: `add(2)`

```javascript []
obj.add(2);
```

- The `_hash(2)` function returns `2 % 769 = 2`. So, the key `2` is added to the bucket at index `2`.
- Now, the bucket at index `2` contains `[2]`.

### Step 4: `contains(1)`

```javascript []
obj.contains(1);
```

- The `_hash(1)` function returns `1 % 769 = 1`.
- The bucket at index `1` contains `[1]`. So, the result is `true`.

### Step 5: `contains(3)`

```javascript []
obj.contains(3);
```

- The `_hash(3)` function returns `3 % 769 = 3`.
- The bucket at index `3` is empty. So, the result is `false`.

### Step 6: `add(2)`

```javascript []
obj.add(2);
```

- The `_hash(2)` function returns `2 % 769 = 2`.
- The bucket at index `2` already contains `[2]`. So, nothing is added (no duplicates).

### Step 7: `contains(2)`

```javascript []
obj.contains(2);
```

- The `_hash(2)` function returns `2 % 769 = 2`.
- The bucket at index `2` contains `[2]`. So, the result is `true`.

### Step 8: `remove(2)`

```javascript []
obj.remove(2);
```

- The `_hash(2)` function returns `2 % 769 = 2`.
- The bucket at index `2` contains `[2]`. The key `2` is

removed.

- Now, the bucket at index `2` is empty.

### Step 9: `contains(2)`

```javascript []
obj.contains(2);
```

- The `_hash(2)` function returns `2 % 769 = 2`.
- The bucket at index `2` is now empty. So, the result is `false`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:

- `add(key)`:

  - Average: O(1) (due to good distribution of keys across buckets)
  - Worst case: O(k), where `k` is the number of elements in the bucket (collisions).

- `remove(key)`:

  - Average: O(1) (constant time with a good hash function)
  - Worst case: O(k) (removing from a bucket with collisions).

- `contains(key)`:
  - Average: O(1) (constant time to check for key)
  - Worst case: O(k) (searching in a bucket with collisions).

### Space Complexity:

- O(n), where `n` is the number of unique keys stored in the hash set. Each key is stored in its respective bucket, and we use 769 buckets for the hash table.
