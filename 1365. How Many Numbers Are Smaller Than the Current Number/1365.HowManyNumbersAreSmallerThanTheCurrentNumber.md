## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var smallerNumbersThanCurrent = function (nums) {
  let output = Array(nums.length).fill(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (j != i && nums[j] < nums[i]) output[i] += 1;
    }
  }
  return output;
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

This solution iterates through each number in `nums`, counting how many other elements are smaller than it. Here’s how the strategy is broken down:

1. Initialization of `output` Array: First, create an array `output` filled with zeroes, which will store the result for each element in `nums`.
2. Nested Loops for Comparison:

   - The outer loop iterates over each element `nums[i]`.
   - For each `nums[i]`, the inner loop checks all other elements `nums[j]`.
   - If `nums[j]` is smaller than `nums[i]`, we increment `output[i]`.

3. Return the Result: Finally, return the `output` array after completing all comparisons.

This straightforward approach effectively identifies the count of smaller numbers for each element by comparing every pair of elements in the array.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

To illustrate this solution’s approach, let’s walk through each input scenario.

### Example 1: `nums = [8, 1, 2, 2, 3]`

1. Initialize `output`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
2. Outer Loop (i = 0, nums[i] = 8):
   - Compare with 1, 2, 2, and 3 → 4 elements are smaller than 8
   - `output` becomes `[4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
3. Outer Loop (i = 1, nums[i] = 1):
   - No element smaller than 1
   - `output` remains `[4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
4. Outer Loop (i = 2, nums[i] = 2):
   - 1 is smaller than 2 → 1 element
   - `output` becomes `[4, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
5. Outer Loop (i = 3, nums[i] = 2):
   - 1 is smaller than 2 → 1 element
   - `output` becomes `[4, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
6. Outer Loop (i = 4, nums[i] = 3):
   - 1, 2, and 2 are smaller than 3 → 3 elements
   - `output` becomes `[4, 0, 1, 1, 3]`

Final output: `[4, 0, 1, 1, 3]`

### Example 2: `nums = [6, 5, 4, 8]`

1. Initialize `output`: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`
2. `nums[0] = 6`: `[2, 0, 0, 0]` (5, 4 are smaller)
3. `nums[1] = 5`: `[2, 1, 0, 0]` (4 is smaller)
4. `nums[2] = 4`: `[2, 1, 0, 0]` (none smaller)
5. `nums[3] = 8`: `[2, 1, 0, 3]` (6, 5, 4 are smaller)

Final output: `[2, 1, 0, 3]`

### Example 3: `nums = [7, 7, 7, 7]`

- No number is smaller for any element, so the final output is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`

  - The solution employs a nested loop to compare each element with every other element, resulting in quadratic time complexity.

- Space Complexity: `O(n)`
  - We use an additional array `output` of size `n` to store the result.

Despite being `O(n^2)`, this approach performs optimally within the constraints and achieves excellent runtime efficiency, as seen by the 0ms runtime.
