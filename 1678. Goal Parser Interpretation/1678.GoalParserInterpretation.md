## ❤️‍🔥 Solution

```javascript []
var interpret = function (command) {
  return command.replaceAll("()", "o").replaceAll("(al)", "al");
};
```

## 🌎 Explanation

The problem statement provides a straightforward mapping: the string "G" maps to "G", the string "()" maps to "o", and the string "(al)" maps to "al". Given these mappings, the task is to replace occurrences of "()" and "(al)" in the input string to their respective interpretations, and then return the modified string.

The strategy employed in the submitted solution is direct and efficient:

1. String Replacement: Utilize JavaScript's `replaceAll` method, which replaces all occurrences of a specified substring with another substring. Here, it's used twice:

   - First, it replaces every occurrence of "()" with "o".
   - Secondly, it replaces every occurrence of "(al)" with "al".

2. Direct Mapping: The function does not iterate or use conditional logic but leverages built-in string functions to map directly from the input to the output format as defined by the problem.

This approach minimizes the need for manual string manipulation and iteration, leveraging efficient built-in methods to handle the replacements.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let's debug the function using the provided examples:

Example 1:

- Input: `command = "G()(al)"`
- Process:
  - First replacement: `G()(al)` -> `Go(al)`
  - Second replacement: `Go(al)` -> `Goal`
- Output: `"Goal"`

Example 2:

- Input: `command = "G()()()()(al)"`
- Process:
  - First replacement: `G()()()()(al)` -> `Goooo(al)`
  - Second replacement: `Goooo(al)` -> `Gooooal`
- Output: `"Gooooal"`

Example 3:

- Input: `command = "(al)G(al)()()G"`
- Process:
  - First replacement: `(al)G(al)()()G` -> `(al)G(al)ooG`
  - Second replacement: `(al)G(al)ooG` -> `alGalooG`
- Output: `"alGalooG"`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string `command`. The `replaceAll` function needs to scan the input string to find all occurrences of the substrings "()" and "(al)", replacing them accordingly. Each replacement operation can be considered linear in terms of the length of the string, as it might need to check each character.

- Space Complexity: O(n), considering the worst case where every character might be part of a replacement. The space complexity primarily depends on the length of the resulting string, which in this function, holds the modified string after all replacements.

This function is optimal in its use of JavaScript's string handling capabilities, ensuring that the solution is both readable and efficient.
