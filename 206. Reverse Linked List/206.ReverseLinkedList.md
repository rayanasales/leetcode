## Solution

```java []
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        return reverseListRecursive(head, null);
    }

    private ListNode reverseListRecursive(ListNode current, ListNode prev) {
        if (current == null) return prev; // Base case: end of list
        ListNode next = current.next; // Save next node
        current.next = prev; // Reverse the link
        return reverseListRecursive(next, current); // Recurse with next node and current as new prev
    }
}
```

```Javascript []
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */

/**
 * Recursively reverse the linked list.
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var reverseList = function(head, prev = null) {
    if (!head) return prev; // Base case: end of the list reached, return new head
    let next = head.next; // Save next node
    head.next = prev; // Reverse current node's pointer
    return reverseList(next, head); // Recurse on the next node
};
```

```python []
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode], prev=None) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return prev  # Base case: if head is None, prev is the new head
        next = head.next  # Save next node
        head.next = prev  # Reverse the link of current node
        return self.reverseList(next, head)  # Recurse with next and current as new prev
```

```C# []
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public ListNode next;
 *     public ListNode(int val=0, ListNode next=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.next = next;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode ReverseList(ListNode head) {
        return ReverseListRecursive(head, null);
    }

    private ListNode ReverseListRecursive(ListNode current, ListNode prev) {
        if (current == null) return prev; // Base case: if current is null, prev is the new head
        ListNode next = current.next; // Store next node
        current.next = prev; // Reverse current node's link
        return ReverseListRecursive(next, current); // Recurse with next node and current as new prev
    }
}
```

## Strategy Explained

The strategy for reversing a singly linked list recursively involves the following key steps:

1. Base Case and Termination: The recursion ends when we encounter a `nil` node (i.e., the end of the list). At this point, we have reached beyond the last node of the list, and the previous node (`prev`) is returned as the new head of the list because it's now the last node encountered before `nil`.

2. Reversal Operation: As we traverse the list recursively, each node’s `next` pointer is redirected to its predecessor. This reversal is the core of flipping the list's direction. The `next` pointer of the current node (`head`) is set to the `prev` node, effectively making the current node point backwards.

3. Recursive Progression: After setting the current node’s pointer, the recursive function is called with the `next` node of the current node (`head.next` before reversal) and the current node itself as the new `prev`. This moves the recursion down the list.

4. Returning the New Head: Once the base case returns the `prev` node up the call stack, each recursive call completes by returning this node, which remains unchanged through all the recursive calls. Thus, the last non-`nil` node processed (originally the last node of the list) becomes the new head.

## Debug Example with Input [1, 2, 3]

Suppose we have a linked list initialized as 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> nil. Here's how the recursive reversal would proceed:

- Initial Call: Start with `head` pointing to `1` and `prev` as `nil`.

  - Current node is `1`, next node is `2`.
  - Redirect `1.next` to `nil` (previously `prev`).
  - Recursive call with `head` now pointing to `2` and `prev` to `1`.

- Second Call: Now `head` is `2`, `prev` is `1`.

  - Current node is `2`, next node is `3`.
  - Redirect `2.next` to `1`.
  - Recursive call with `head` now pointing to `3` and `prev` to `2`.

- Third Call: Now `head` is `3`, `prev` is `2`.

  - Current node is `3`, next node is `nil`.
  - Redirect `3.next` to `2`.
  - Recursive call with `head` now `nil` (end of the original list) and `prev` to `3`.

- Base Case Reached: With `head` as `nil`, the function returns `prev`, which is `3`. This is the new head of the reversed list.

- Unwinding the Stack: Each recursive layer returns the new head (`3`), back up to the first call.

The final output of this process is the list starting with `3` and linking backwards through `2` to `1`, effectively reversing the original list.
