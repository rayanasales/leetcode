## Background: what you need to know

Understanding how the binary tree is constructed from an input like `root = [1,2,3,null,5]` is important to solving problems involving binary trees. So let's dig in:

### Explanation of Tree Construction from an Array

1. **Array Representation of a Binary Tree**:

   - The input array represents a binary tree using a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal).
   - The first element of the array is the root of the tree.
   - For any node at index `i` in the array:
     - The left child is located at index `2 * i + 1`.
     - The right child is located at index `2 * i + 2`.
   - If an element is `null`, it indicates the absence of a node at that position in the tree.

2. **Example: `root = [1,2,3,null,5]`**:

   - Let's break this down:
     - `1` is the root node.
     - `2` is the left child of `1`.
     - `3` is the right child of `1`.
     - `null` indicates that the left child of `2` is absent.
     - `5` is the right child of `2`.

   The tree looks like this:

   ```
       1
      / \
     2   3
      \
       5
   ```

   - **Node 1**:
     - Left child: 2 (index `1`)
     - Right child: 3 (index `2`)
   - **Node 2**:
     - Left child: `null` (index `3` - no node here)
     - Right child: 5 (index `4`)
   - **Node 3**:
     - No children (indices `5` and `6` are out of bounds for this example)

### Constructing the Tree in Code

To work with the tree, we usually have a function that converts this array into a tree structure using the `TreeNode` class. Here's how it might look in JavaScript:

```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
  this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
  this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
  this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
}

function arrayToTree(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return null;

  // Create the root node
  let root = new TreeNode(arr[0]);
  let queue = [root];
  let i = 1;

  // Iterate through the array, constructing the tree level by level
  while (i < arr.length) {
    let current = queue.shift();

    // Left child
    if (i < arr.length && arr[i] !== null) {
      current.left = new TreeNode(arr[i]);
      queue.push(current.left);
    }
    i++;

    // Right child
    if (i < arr.length && arr[i] !== null) {
      current.right = new TreeNode(arr[i]);
      queue.push(current.right);
    }
    i++;
  }

  return root;
}
```

### How the Code Works:

- **`TreeNode` Constructor**: Defines each node in the tree with a value (`val`), and pointers to the left and right children.
- **`arrayToTree` Function**:
  - Converts the array into a binary tree structure.
  - It uses a queue to keep track of nodes whose children have yet to be assigned.
  - As the function iterates through the array, it assigns left and right children to each node according to the level-order indices.

### Using the Tree:

Now, when you have the tree created by `arrayToTree([1,2,3,null,5])`, you can easily traverse it or solve problems related to binary trees by applying algorithms like the one we discussed earlier (DFS for finding all root-to-leaf paths).

## Strategy to solve the problem `257. Binary Tree Paths`

1. **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The most natural way to explore all paths from the root to the leaves in a binary tree is by using DFS. This approach will traverse the tree, visiting each node and building the path as it goes.
   - Whenever a leaf node (a node with no children) is reached, the current path is added to the result.
2. **Path Construction**:
   - As we traverse the tree, we accumulate the path in a string. If the current node has children, we continue appending to the path string. When we reach a leaf node, we add the full path string to the result array.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the tree is empty (i.e., `root` is null), the result should be an empty array.
   - If the tree has only one node, the result should contain just one path, which is the value of that single node.

## Javascript Solution

```js
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var binaryTreePaths = function (root) {
  // Initialize an array to store all root-to-leaf paths.
  const result = [];

  // Helper function to perform DFS on the tree.
  function dfs(node, path) {
    if (node) {
      // If the current node is not null
      // Append the current node's value to the path.
      path += node.val;

      // If the current node is a leaf (no left and right children), add the path to the result.
      if (!node.left && !node.right) {
        result.push(path);
      } else {
        // If the current node is not a leaf, continue the DFS on both children.
        // Add '->' to the path before going deeper.
        path += "->";
        dfs(node.left, path);
        dfs(node.right, path);
      }
    }
  }

  // Start DFS with the root node and an empty path string.
  dfs(root, "");

  // Return the array of all root-to-leaf paths.
  return result;
};
```

## Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `result`: This array will store all the paths from the root to each leaf node.
2. **DFS Helper Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is a recursive function that takes the current `node` and the `path` string accumulated so far as its parameters.
   - For each node, we append its value to the `path` string.
   - If the node is a leaf (both `left` and `right` are null), we push the `path` string to the `result` array.
   - If the node is not a leaf, we append `"->"` to the `path` and recursively call `dfs` on the left and right children.
3. **Edge Handling**:
   - If the input `root` is null, the DFS is never initiated, and the `result` array remains empty.
4. **Efficiency**:
   - The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
   - The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, which corresponds to the depth of the recursion stack.
