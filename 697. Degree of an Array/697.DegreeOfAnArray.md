## üåé Strategy

In the problem, we are given an array of non-negative integers, and the goal is to find the smallest subarray that has the same degree as the entire array. The degree of an array is the maximum frequency of any element in the array.

### Key Observations:

1. _Degree of Array_: The degree is defined by the maximum frequency of any element. Therefore, we must identify the element(s) that appear most frequently.
2. _Finding Subarray_: Once we know the elements with the highest frequency (the degree), we then need to find the shortest contiguous subarray that includes all occurrences of that element.

### Plan for Optimization:

To solve this in the most efficient way, we should aim for the following:

1. _Single pass frequency calculation_: During the first pass through the array, we will calculate the frequency of each element and simultaneously track the first and last positions of each element.

2. _Degree calculation on-the-fly_: As we traverse the array, we also compute the degree (maximum frequency) on-the-fly, avoiding the need for an extra loop to determine the degree.

3. _Minimizing operations_: Instead of using multiple passes, we ensure that both frequency counting and subarray boundary tracking (first and last occurrence) are done in a single traversal.

By ensuring a linear time complexity (O(n)) and minimal space usage, we can achieve a highly efficient solution that works even for large input sizes.

## üöÄ Commented Solution

```javascript []
var findShortestSubArray = function (nums) {
  let frequence = {}; // Map to store the frequency of each number
  let firstIndex = {}; // Map to store the first occurrence of each number
  let lastIndex = {}; // Map to store the last occurrence of each number
  let degree = 0; // The degree of the array
  let minLength = nums.length; // Initialize minimum length to the max possible

  // Traverse the array once
  nums.forEach((n, i) => {
    // Set the first occurrence of the number if not already set
    if (firstIndex[n] === undefined) firstIndex[n] = i;
    // Set the last occurrence of the number
    lastIndex[n] = i;
    // Increment the frequency count
    frequence[n] = (frequence[n] || 0) + 1;
    // Update the degree of the array
    degree = Math.max(degree, frequence[n]);
  });

  // Now find the smallest subarray with the same degree
  for (let n in frequence) {
    if (frequence[n] === degree) {
      // Calculate the length of the subarray for this number
      minLength = Math.min(minLength, lastIndex[n] - firstIndex[n] + 1);
    }
  }

  return minLength;
};
```

### Code Explanation:

1. Step 1: Frequency Counting and Tracking Indexes

   - `frequence`: Tracks how often each element appears.
   - `firstIndex`: Stores the index of the first occurrence of each element.
   - `lastIndex`: Stores the index of the last occurrence of each element.
   - Degree calculation happens during this pass as we update `degree` to reflect the highest frequency.

2. Step 2: Finding the Shortest Subarray
   - After identifying the element(s) that define the degree, we loop through the elements in `frequence` and calculate the length of the subarray for each element that has the maximum frequency.
   - We keep track of the minimum length of subarrays that match the degree.

## üîé Step-by-Step Debugging

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1]
```

1. Frequency Map:

   - `frequence = { 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1 }`
   - Degree = 2 (since elements `1` and `2` appear twice).

2. First and Last Occurrences:

   - `firstIndex = { 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3 }`
   - `lastIndex = { 1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 3 }`

3. Finding the Shortest Subarray:
   - For element `1`: Subarray `[1,2,2,3,1]` (length 5).
   - For element `2`: Subarray `[2,2]` (length 2).
4. Result:
   - The shortest subarray with degree 2 is `[2,2]` with length 2, so the output is 2.

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
```

1. Frequency Map:

   - `frequence = { 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1 }`
   - Degree = 3 (since element `2` appears three times).

2. First and Last Occurrences:

   - `firstIndex = { 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: 5 }`
   - `lastIndex = { 1: 4, 2: 6, 3: 3, 4: 5 }`

3. Finding the Shortest Subarray:
   - For element `2`: Subarray `[2,2,3,1,4,2]` (length 6).
4. Result:
   - The shortest subarray with degree 3 is `[2,2,3,1,4,2]` with length 6, so the output is 6.

## üìä Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- We perform a single pass through the array to calculate frequencies, track first and last positions, and compute the degree.
- A second pass over the distinct elements (not the full array) is done to determine the shortest subarray length.

### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is O(k), where `k` is the number of distinct elements in the array.
- We store the frequency, first occurrence, and last occurrence for each distinct element in `nums`. Therefore, our space usage is proportional to the number of unique elements, not the total number of elements.

This ensures that the solution uses the least amount of memory possible for large input sizes.
