## 🚀 Code Solution

Here’s the code solution for the Defanging an IP Address problem:

```javascript []
var defangIPaddr = function (address) {
  return address.replaceAll(".", "[.]");
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

The strategy for solving this problem is straightforward yet highly effective. The key lies in leveraging string manipulation functions provided by JavaScript. Here’s how the approach works:

1. Understand the Input and Output:

   - The input is a valid IPv4 address represented as a string.
   - The output is a modified version of the input string where every `.` (period) is replaced with `[.]`.

2. Identify the Best Tool for Replacement:

   - JavaScript provides a built-in `replaceAll()` function that allows replacing all occurrences of a substring within a string.
   - Using `replaceAll()` ensures that every occurrence of `.` in the input string is transformed into `[.]`.

3. Return the Result:
   - After applying the replacement, the modified string is directly returned as the output.

This approach is clean, efficient, and avoids the need for manual loops or auxiliary data structures.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s debug the code step-by-step with example inputs.

### Example 1:

Input: `address = "1.1.1.1"`

1. Initial Input:

   - `address = "1.1.1.1"`

2. Apply `replaceAll()` Method:

   - Replace all `.` with `[.]`.
   - Result after replacement: `"1[.]1[.]1[.]1"`

3. Output:
   - Return `"1[.]1[.]1[.]1"`.

Output: `"1[.]1[.]1[.]1"`

### Example 2:

Input: `address = "255.100.50.0"`

1. Initial Input:

   - `address = "255.100.50.0"`

2. Apply `replaceAll()` Method:

   - Replace all `.` with `[.]`.
   - Result after replacement: `"255[.]100[.]50[.]0"`

3. Output:
   - Return `"255[.]100[.]50[.]0"`.

Output: `"255[.]100[.]50[.]0"`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- The `replaceAll()` method traverses the string once to locate all occurrences of the target substring (`"."`) and performs the replacement.
- Let `n` be the length of the input string.
- Time Complexity: O(n).

### Space Complexity:

- The `replaceAll()` method creates a new string to store the modified version of the input.
- This requires additional space proportional to the size of the input string.
- Space Complexity: O(n).
