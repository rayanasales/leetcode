## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
/*
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
 */
var moveZeroes = function (nums) {
  let left = 0;

  // Shift all non-zero elements to the front
  for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    if (nums[right] !== 0) {
      // Swap only when left and right are different
      if (left !== right) {
        let temp = nums[left];
        nums[left] = nums[right];
        nums[right] = temp;
      }
      left++; // Move left to the next position for non-zero elements
    }
  }

  // The array is now modified in-place with all zeroes at the end
};
```

## 🌎 Strategy

The goal of this problem is to move all zeros in the array to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The challenge is to do this in-place, without creating additional arrays, and achieve optimal time complexity, ideally O(n).

### Detailed Explanation:

1. Two-pointer approach:
   - We use two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `right` pointer scans through the array to find non-zero elements. The `left` pointer tracks the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
   - The basic strategy is to shift all non-zero elements to the beginning of the array while keeping track of the `left` pointer.
2. Conditional swapping:

   - A conditional swap happens only if `left` and `right` are at different positions (i.e., to avoid unnecessary writes when the non-zero element is already in place).

3. Final zero-fill:
   - Once all non-zero elements are placed at the front, the rest of the array should be filled with zeros. This ensures that the zeros are at the end while the relative order of non-zero elements is preserved.

#### Plan for Optimization

- Minimizing redundant operations: The code minimizes unnecessary swaps by checking if `left` and `right` are different. This reduces memory writes, improving performance.
- Single-pass shifting: By using a two-pointer technique, we can shift non-zero elements and place them in the correct position in one pass. This makes the algorithm more efficient, achieving O(n) time complexity.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let's walk through a step-by-step debugging example using this input:

### Input: `nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`

1. Initial State:

   ```
   nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
   left = 0, right = 0
   ```

2. Iteration 1 (right = 0):

   - `nums[right] = 0` → No action, increment `right`.

3. Iteration 2 (right = 1):
   - `nums[right] = 1` (non-zero):
     - Swap `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` (since `left = 0` and `right = 1` are different).
     - After Swap: `nums = [1, 0, 0, 3, 12]`
     - Increment `left` to 1.
4. Iteration 3 (right = 2):

   - `nums[right] = 0` → No action, increment `right`.

5. Iteration 4 (right = 3):

   - `nums[right] = 3` (non-zero):
     - Swap `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` (since `left = 1` and `right = 3` are different).
     - After Swap: `nums = [1, 3, 0, 0, 12]`
     - Increment `left` to 2.

6. Iteration 5 (right = 4):

   - `nums[right] = 12` (non-zero):
     - Swap `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` (since `left = 2` and `right = 4` are different).
     - After Swap: `nums = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`
     - Increment `left` to 3.

7. Final State:
   - `nums = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`
   - All non-zero elements are moved to the front, and zeros are at the end.

### Edge Case:

Input: `nums = [0]`

- In this case, the array contains only one element (which is zero). Since there are no non-zero elements, the array remains `[0]` with no changes.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity:
  - O(n) – The algorithm makes one pass through the array (linear time) to move non-zero elements to the front and fill the remaining positions with zeros. Every element is visited exactly once.
- Space Complexity:
  - O(1) – The solution modifies the array in-place without using any extra space. Only a few variables (`left`, `right`, and `temp`) are used for swapping, which takes constant space.
