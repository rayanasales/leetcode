## 🚀 Commented Solution

```javascript []
/*
 * @param {number} numRows
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var generate = function (numRows) {
  let output = [[1], [1, 1]]; // Base cases: The first two rows of Pascal's Triangle
  if (numRows === 1) return [[1]]; // Special case: If numRows is 1, return just the first row
  if (numRows === 2) return output; // Special case: If numRows is 2, return the first two rows

  // Start generating rows from the 3rd row onward
  for (let rowIndex = 3; rowIndex <= numRows; rowIndex++) {
    let rowItems = Array(rowIndex); // Create the row with length = rowIndex (e.g., rowIndex = 3 means we need 3 elements)
    rowItems[0] = 1; // The first element of every row is always 1
    rowItems[rowIndex - 1] = 1; // The last element of every row is always 1

    // Calculation for the in-between items (those that aren't at the edges)
    for (let itemIndex = 1; itemIndex < rowIndex - 1; itemIndex++) {
      let rowAbove = rowIndex - 2; // Reference the row directly above (because arrays are zero-indexed)
      let valueAboveLeft = output[rowAbove][itemIndex - 1]; // Get the value to the left in the row above
      let valueAboveRight = output[rowAbove][itemIndex]; // Get the value directly above
      rowItems[itemIndex] = valueAboveLeft + valueAboveRight; // The sum of the two values above gives the current value
    }

    output.push(rowItems); // Append the newly generated row to the output
  }
  return output; // Return the complete Pascal's Triangle
};
```

## 💎 Strategy

The core idea of Pascal’s Triangle is that each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle begins with a `1` at the top, and the edges of the triangle are always `1`.

The approach can be broken down into these steps:

1. Base Case:
   The first two rows of Pascal's Triangle are well-known: `[1]` and `[1, 1]`. We initialize the `output` array with these rows.
2. Row Construction:
   Starting from the third row (`rowIndex = 3`), we generate each row dynamically:
   - First and Last Elements: These are always `1`, and thus we set `rowItems[0]` and `rowItems[rowIndex - 1]` to `1`.
   - Middle Elements: For each middle element (i.e., not at the edges), we calculate its value as the sum of two numbers from the row above:
     - The value directly above (`output[rowIndex - 2][itemIndex]`)
     - The value to the left above (`output[rowIndex - 2][itemIndex - 1]`)
3. Final Step: Once the row is computed, it's appended to the `output` array, and this process repeats until all rows are generated.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

Let’s debug the function step by step using some example inputs:

### Input: numRows = 1

- The base case directly triggers and returns `[[1]]`, as only one row is required.

### Input: numRows = 2

- The base case again triggers and returns `[[1], [1, 1]]`, as two rows are required, and these are pre-defined.

### Input: numRows = 5

1. We initialize `output = [[1], [1, 1]]`.
2. We start from `rowIndex = 3`:
   - Create an array of length 3, `rowItems = [1, undefined, 1]`.
   - Compute the middle element: `rowItems[1] = output[1][0] + output[1][1] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Append the row: `output = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]`.
3. For `rowIndex = 4`:
   - Create an array of length 4, `rowItems = [1, undefined, undefined, 1]`.
   - Compute middle elements:
     - `rowItems[1] = output[2][0] + output[2][1] = 1 + 2 = 3`.
     - `rowItems[2] = output[2][1] + output[2][2] = 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Append the row: `output = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]`.
4. For `rowIndex = 5`:

   - Create an array of length 5, `rowItems = [1, undefined, undefined, undefined, 1]`.
   - Compute middle elements:
     - `rowItems[1] = output[3][0] + output[3][1] = 1 + 3 = 4`.
     - `rowItems[2] = output[3][1] + output[3][2] = 3 + 3 = 6`.
     - `rowItems[3] = output[3][2] + output[3][3] = 3 + 1 = 4`.
   - Append the row: `output = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]`.

### Debug Output:

```json []
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
```

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity is O(n²), where `n` is `numRows`. This is because:

- For each row, we iterate over all the elements in the previous row, leading to an increasing number of operations per row (1 element in the first row, 2 in the second row, etc.).
- In total, this sums to `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n`, which is the sum of an arithmetic series and simplifies to O(n²).

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(n²) as well because we store all the rows generated in the `output` array, and there are `n` rows with increasing numbers of elements (i.e., `n` rows, with each row having up to `n` elements).

If only the last row were required, this could be reduced to O(n) by keeping only the last row in memory.
