## Javascript Solution

```js
var isEmpty = function (obj) {
  return Object.keys(obj).length === 0;
};
```

## Explanation

The function isEmpty is designed to check if a given object is empty.

1. **Object Keys Length Check**:
   - The function uses Object.keys(obj) to get an array of the object's own enumerable property names.
   - It then checks the length of this array.
   - If the length is 0, it means the object has no own properties and is therefore empty.
   - The function returns true if the object is empty and false otherwise.
