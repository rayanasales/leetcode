## 🚀 Code Solution

```javascript []
var numIdenticalPairs = function (nums) {
  let goodPairs = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] == nums[j]) goodPairs++;
    }
  }
  return goodPairs;
};
```

### Explanation

The code iterates through all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`, ensuring that each pair is checked only once. By leveraging this comparison, the function counts pairs efficiently and returns the total.

## 💎 Strategy

The strategy for solving this problem revolves around:

1. Pair Comparison with Index Conditions: We only consider pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] == nums[j]`. By ensuring `i < j`, we avoid duplicate pairs (like counting `(i, j)` and `(j, i)`).
2. Efficiency through Nested Loops: By starting the inner loop at `i + 1`, we effectively reduce the comparisons, saving time over a complete `O(n^2)` check.
3. Minimal Conditional Logic: The condition `nums[i] == nums[j]` keeps the checks simple, only incrementing `goodPairs` when there is a match.

### Why This Strategy Works:

- Clarity and Simplicity: The code is straightforward, and each comparison is clear.
- Optimized Inner Loop Start: Starting `j` from `i + 1` rather than `0` eliminates unnecessary comparisons.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging

We’ll walk through each of the example inputs to confirm the logic step-by-step.

### Example 1: `[1,2,3,1,1,3]`

1. Start with `goodPairs = 0`.
2. For `i = 0` (value `1`), the inner loop finds:
   - `j = 3` (value `1`), so `goodPairs++` → `goodPairs = 1`
   - `j = 4` (value `1`), so `goodPairs++` → `goodPairs = 2`
3. For `i = 2` (value `3`), the inner loop finds:
   - `j = 5` (value `3`), so `goodPairs++` → `goodPairs = 4`
4. Output: `4`, which matches the expected result.

### Example 2: `[1,1,1,1]`

1. For each `i`, every `j` where `j > i` matches `nums[i]`, giving 6 pairs.
2. Output: `6`, as expected.

### Example 3: `[1,2,3]`

1. Each element is unique, so no good pairs.
2. Output: `0`, as expected.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\)

- The function has a nested loop, where for each `i`, the inner loop runs `n-i` times. This results in a complexity of \(O(n^2)\), but for a constraint of `n <= 100`, it performs efficiently.

Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)

- Only a single integer variable `goodPairs` is used, making space complexity constant.
