## Solution in javascript

```javascript []
var join = function (arr1, arr2) {
  let mergedArr = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // Merge both arrays into a single array
  let result = {}; // Initialize an empty object to store merged results by id

  for (const item of mergedArr) {
    if (!result[item.id]) {
      // If the id does not yet exist in the result object, add the item as is
      result[item.id] = item;
      continue; // Skip to the next iteration
    }
    result[item.id] = { ...result[item.id], ...item }; // If the id already exists, merge the current item with the existing one.
  }
  return Object.values(result); // Convert the result object back to an array of values and return it
};
```

### Explanation:

This code provides a simple approach to merge two arrays of objects based on their `id` fields. Here's how it works:

1. Merging the Arrays:
   - The function begins by concatenating `arr1` and `arr2` into a single array called `mergedArr`. This combines all objects from both arrays into one sequence. The `concat` method does this without modifying the original arrays.
2. Using an Object to Track Merged Results:
   - An empty object called `result` is initialized. This object will store the merged objects using their `id` as the key.
   - By using an object, we can efficiently check whether an `id` has already been encountered, making it easy to merge objects with the same `id`.
3. Iterating Over the Merged Array:
   - The `for...of` loop iterates over each `item` in the `mergedArr`.
   - First Encounter of an `id`:
     - If the `id` of the current `item` does not exist in `result`, it means this `id` is being encountered for the first time. The entire `item` is added to `result` under its `id`.
     - The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the loop and move on to the next item.
   - Merging Objects with the Same `id`:
     - If the `id` already exists in `result`, it means there's already an object stored with this `id`. The code merges the existing object in `result` with the current `item` using the spread operator (`...`).
     - The spread operator `{...result[item.id], ...item}` creates a new object by combining all properties of the existing object and the current `item`. If both objects have the same key, the value from `item` (from `arr2`) will override the one from `result` (from `arr1`).
4. Converting the Result Object Back to an Array:
   - Once the loop has processed all items in `mergedArr`, `result` contains all merged objects, keyed by `id`.
   - The final step is to convert the `result` object back into an array using `Object.values(result)`. This returns an array of all the values (merged objects) in `result`, which is then returned as the final output.
