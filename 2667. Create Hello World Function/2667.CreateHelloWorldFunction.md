## Javascript Solution

```js
/**
 * @return {Function}
 */
var createHelloWorld = function () {
  return () => "Hello World";
};

/**
 * const f = createHelloWorld();
 * f(); // "Hello World"
 */
```

## Explanation

### Intuition

When faced with the problem of creating a function that consistently returns "Hello World" irrespective of any input arguments, my immediate thought was to focus on simplicity and efficiency. The essence of the task lies in returning a fixed string, which hints at an approach that minimizes overhead and maximizes performance.

### Approach

Initially, I considered a straightforward solution that encapsulates the "Hello World" string within a closure to prevent global pollution and unnecessary computations. The initial implementation looked like this:

```javascript
var createHelloWorld = function () {
  const hello = "Hello World";
  return (...args) => hello;
};
```

This version uses a closure to keep the "Hello World" string encapsulated and returns a function that takes any number of arguments but ignores them, always returning the string. However, after further analysis, I realized that the spread operator (`...args`) introduces unnecessary overhead by handling an indefinite number of arguments, which is redundant since these arguments are never used.

To optimize, I revised the implementation to eliminate all extraneous elements:

```javascript
/**
 * @return {Function}
 */
var createHelloWorld = function () {
  return () => "Hello World";
};
```
