## 🌎 Strategy

1. **Initialization**:

   - `maxConsecutive`: Keeps track of the maximum number of consecutive 1s found so far.
   - `currentConsecutive`: Tracks the current sequence of 1s while iterating through the array.

2. **For loop**:
   - As you loop through the array, if a `1` is found, the `currentConsecutive` count is increased.
   - When a `0` is encountered, the current streak is over. We then compare the current streak (`currentConsecutive`) with `maxConsecutive` to update the maximum if necessary, and reset `currentConsecutive` to 0.
3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop ends, it's possible that the array ends with a streak of 1s. Therefore, we return the maximum between `maxConsecutive` and `currentConsecutive` to ensure the result is correct even if the array ends with 1s.

#### Plan for Optimization

1. **Minimize operations**: Avoid multiple checks when updating the maximum consecutive ones.
2. **Memory efficiency**: Use only a few variables to track necessary states (`maxConsecutive` and `currentConsecutives`).
3. **Complexity reduction**: Ensure the solution is linear (`O(n)`) because that's optimal for a problem involving a single scan of the array.

## 🚀 Commented Solution

```javascript []
var findMaxConsecutiveOnes = function (nums) {
  let maxConsecutive = 0; // To store the maximum number of consecutive 1s
  let currentConsecutive = 0; // To store the current streak of 1s

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // If we encounter a 1, we increment the current streak count
    if (nums[i] === 1) {
      currentConsecutive++;
    } else {
      // If we encounter a 0, we compare the current streak with max
      // Then reset the current streak counter
      maxConsecutive = Math.max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
      currentConsecutive = 0;
    }
  }

  // After the loop, we return the maximum of the last streak and the previous maxConsecutive
  return Math.max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
};
```

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Debugging:

Let’s walk through an example:

**Example 1**:
Input: `[1,1,0,1,1,1]`

1. `i=0`, `nums[0] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 1.
2. `i=1`, `nums[1] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 2.
3. `i=2`, `nums[2] = 0`: Update `maxConsecutive` to 2 (as `currentConsecutive = 2`), then reset `currentConsecutive` to 0.
4. `i=3`, `nums[3] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 1.
5. `i=4`, `nums[4] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 2.
6. `i=5`, `nums[5] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 3.

Final check: `maxConsecutive = 2`, `currentConsecutive = 3`. Return `max(2, 3)` = `3`.

**Example 2**:
Input: `[1,0,1,1,0,1]`

1. `i=0`, `nums[0] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 1.
2. `i=1`, `nums[1] = 0`: Update `maxConsecutive` to 1, reset `currentConsecutive` to 0.
3. `i=2`, `nums[2] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 1.
4. `i=3`, `nums[3] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 2.
5. `i=4`, `nums[4] = 0`: Update `maxConsecutive` to 2, reset `currentConsecutive` to 0.
6. `i=5`, `nums[5] = 1`: Increment `currentConsecutive` to 1.

Final check: `maxConsecutive = 2`, `currentConsecutive = 1`. Return `max(2, 1)` = `2`.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array, because we are iterating through the array only once.
- **Space complexity**: O(1), as we are using only two extra variables (`maxConsecutive` and `currentConsecutive`) regardless of the size of the input array.
