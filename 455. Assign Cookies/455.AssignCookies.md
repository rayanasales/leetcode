## 🌎 Strategy

The goal is to maximize the number of content children by assigning each child at most one cookie. Each child has a "greed factor" which represents the minimum size of a cookie they will be satisfied with. Our goal is to give cookies to as many children as possible using the given cookie sizes.

### Key Strategy

1. **Sort Both Arrays:** By sorting both the children's greed factors and the cookie sizes, we can efficiently match the smallest available cookie to the least greedy child.
2. **Greedy Matching:** Use the smallest cookie that can satisfy the least greedy child, then move to the next child and cookie. This ensures the maximum number of content children.

### Why This Works

- **Sorting ensures** that we match each child with the smallest possible cookie that can satisfy them.
- **Two-pointer technique** is optimal for traversing the arrays in linear time after sorting, making the solution efficient.

## 🚀 Commented Solution

```javascript []
var findContentChildren = function (kids, cookies) {
  // Step 1: Sort both arrays in ascending order
  kids.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  cookies.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let childPointer = 0;
  let cookiePointer = 0;

  // Step 2: Use two-pointer technique to assign cookies
  while (childPointer < kids.length && cookiePointer < cookies.length) {
    if (cookies[cookiePointer] >= kids[childPointer]) {
      // Step 3: If the cookie satisfies the child, move to the next child
      childPointer++;
    }
    // Step 4: Move to the next cookie in both cases
    cookiePointer++;
  }

  // Step 5: Return the number of children that have been satisfied
  return childPointer;
};
```

## 🔎 Debug Demonstration for All Test Cases

### Test Case 1:

```text
Input: kids = [1, 2, 3], cookies = [1, 1]
```

1. **Sorting:**
   - `kids` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`
   - `cookies` becomes `[1, 1]`
2. **Process:**
   - First, match `kids[0] = 1` with `cookies[0] = 1` → match! (`childPointer` becomes 1, `cookiePointer` becomes 1)
   - Next, try to match `kids[1] = 2` with `cookies[1] = 1` → no match! (`cookiePointer` becomes 2)
   - No more cookies available.

**Output:** `1`

### Test Case 2:

```text
Input: kids = [1, 2], cookies = [1, 2, 3]
```

1. **Sorting:**
   - `kids` becomes `[1, 2]`
   - `cookies` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`
2. **Process:**
   - First, match `kids[0] = 1` with `cookies[0] = 1` → match! (`childPointer` becomes 1, `cookiePointer` becomes 1)
   - Next, match `kids[1] = 2` with `cookies[1] = 2` → match! (`childPointer` becomes 2, `cookiePointer` becomes 2)
   - No more children to satisfy.

**Output:** `2`

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n log n):** Sorting both the greed factors and the cookie sizes takes `O(n log n)`. After sorting, we traverse both arrays linearly using two pointers, which takes `O(n)`. The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(1):** We are using constant extra space beyond the input arrays for pointers and variables. No additional data structures are used, making the space complexity minimal.
