## Solution

```java []
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        // Create a list to store the node values for easy comparison
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

        // Traverse the linked list and add each node's value to the list
        while(head != null) {
            list.add(head.val);
            head = head.next; // Move to the next node
        }

        // Initialize two pointers: one at the start (left) and one at the end (right)
        int left = 0;
        int right = list.size() - 1;

        // Compare values from both ends of the list moving towards the center
        // If at any point the values don't match, it's not a palindrome
        while(left < right && list.get(left) == list.get(right)) {
            left++; // Move the left pointer towards the center
            right--; // Move the right pointer towards the center
        }

        // If the pointers have crossed, it means all compared values were the same, so it's a palindrome
        return left >= right;
    }
}
```

```javascript []
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
var isPalindrome = function (head) {
  // Create an array to store node values for comparison
  const list = [];

  // Traverse the linked list and push each node's value to the array
  while (head !== null) {
    list.push(head.val);
    head = head.next; // Move to the next node
  }

  // Initialize two pointers: one at the start (left) and one at the end (right)
  let left = 0;
  let right = list.length - 1;

  // Compare values from both ends of the list moving towards the center
  while (left < right && list[left] === list[right]) {
    left++; // Move the left pointer towards the center
    right--; // Move the right pointer towards the center
  }

  // If the pointers have crossed, all compared values were the same, so it's a palindrome
  return left >= right;
};
```

## Explanation of the Strategy:

1. **Traversal**: We first traverse the entire linked list, collecting each node’s value in a sequential order. This gives us a structure (an array or list) where we can easily access the values in both directions (forward and backward).
2. **Two-pointer technique**: Once we have the list of values, we set up two pointers:

   - **Left pointer**: Starts at the beginning of the list.
   - **Right pointer**: Starts at the end of the list.

   The idea is to compare the values at both ends. If the values are the same, we move both pointers toward the center (left pointer moves right, right pointer moves left) and continue comparing.

3. **Palindrome check**: If all the corresponding values from both ends match, the list is a palindrome. If any mismatch occurs, it means the list isn’t a palindrome.

4. **Completion condition**: The process stops when the left pointer crosses the right pointer (indicating we have compared all pairs). At this point, if no mismatches have been found, the linked list is confirmed to be a palindrome.

## Debugging Input: `[1, 2, 2, 1]`

- **Step 1 (Traversal)**: The list is traversed, and the node values are stored in a list or array: `[1, 2, 2, 1]`.

- **Step 2 (Initialize pointers)**:

  - Left pointer starts at index 0 (value `1`).
  - Right pointer starts at index 3 (value `1`).

- **Step 3 (First comparison)**:

  - Compare values at index 0 (left pointer) and index 3 (right pointer): `1 == 1`.
  - Since they are equal, move the pointers: left pointer moves to index 1, right pointer moves to index 2.

- **Step 4 (Second comparison)**:

  - Compare values at index 1 (left pointer) and index 2 (right pointer): `2 == 2`.
  - Since they are equal, move the pointers again: left pointer moves to index 2, right pointer moves to index 1.

- **Step 5 (Completion)**:
  - The left pointer has crossed the right pointer (left is 2, right is 1).
  - Since all compared values matched, the list is confirmed to be a palindrome.
  - **Result**: `true`.
