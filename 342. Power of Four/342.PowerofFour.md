### JavaScript Explanation and Solution

In JavaScript, one of the most efficient ways to check if a number is a power of four without using loops or recursion is by leveraging bitwise operations. A power of four has the following properties:

1. It is a positive number.
2. It has only one bit set in its binary representation (i.e., it’s a power of two).
3. The only set bit must be in an odd position (since the positions are 0-indexed).

Bitwise Logic:

- The bitwise `AND` operation between `n` and `n-1` should be `0` to ensure it's a power of two.
- We check if the only set bit is in an odd position by using a mask `0x55555555`. This hexadecimal number is `01010101010101010101010101010101` in binary, which covers all odd positions.

Here's the JavaScript implementation:

```JavaScript []
function isPowerOfFour(n) {
  // Check if n is positive, a power of two, and the only set bit is in an odd position.
  return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) === 0 && (n & 0x55555555) !== 0;
}
```

### Java Explanation and Solution

In Java, the logic is identical, but we need to be careful with data types because Java strictly checks types.

Here's the Java implementation:

```java []
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        // Check if n is positive, a power of two, and the only set bit is in an odd position.
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0 && (n & 0x55555555) != 0;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- `n > 0`: Ensures that `n` is positive.
- `(n & (n - 1)) === 0`: This check ensures that `n` is a power of two. Any number that is a power of two has only one bit set in its binary form. When you subtract 1 from such a number, all bits before the set bit become 1, and the set bit becomes 0. The `AND` operation between `n` and `n-1` will then be `0`.
- `(n & 0x55555555) !== 0`: This ensures that the single set bit is in an odd position, which is necessary for the number to be a power of four.
