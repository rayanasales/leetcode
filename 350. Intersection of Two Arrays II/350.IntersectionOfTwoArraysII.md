## 🌎 Strategy

The task is to find the **intersection of two arrays**, where each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays. To achieve **0 ms runtime** and **beat 100%**, we must focus on optimizing time complexity and memory usage.

### Approach

1. **Frequency Counting:** The key to solving this problem efficiently is counting how many times each element appears in `nums1` and `nums2`, and then taking the **minimum count** for each common element.
2. **Array as Frequency Map:** Since the elements range from 0 to 1000, we can use an **array of fixed size 1001** to store the frequencies of elements from both `nums1` and `nums2`, avoiding the overhead of using hash maps or sets.
3. **Efficient Array Traversal:** By using two simple array traversals (one for counting and one for collecting the result), we can solve this problem in linear time, O(n + m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the two input arrays.

## 🚀 Solution - Java runtime 0 ms, Beats 100%

```java []
class Solution {
    public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        // Step 1: Create a frequency array for nums1
        int[] freq = new int[1001];
        for (int num : nums1) {
            freq[num]++; // Count frequency of each element in nums1
        }

        // Step 2: Prepare a temporary array to store the result
        int[] tempResult = new int[Math.min(nums1.length, nums2.length)];
        int index = 0;

        // Step 3: Traverse nums2 and collect the intersection
        for (int num : nums2) {
            if (freq[num] > 0) {
                tempResult[index++] = num; // Add the number to the result
                freq[num]--; // Decrease the frequency count
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Copy the result to an array of the correct size
        int[] result = new int[index];
        System.arraycopy(tempResult, 0, result, 0, index);
        return result;
    }
}
```

```javascript []
var intersect = function (nums1, nums2) {
  // Step 1: Create a frequency array for nums1
  let freq = new Array(1001).fill(0);
  nums1.forEach((num) => freq[num]++); // Count frequency of each element in nums1

  // Step 2: Collect the intersection
  let result = [];
  nums2.forEach((num) => {
    if (freq[num] > 0) {
      result.push(num); // Add the number to the result
      freq[num]--; // Decrease the frequency count
    }
  });

  return result;
};
```

## 🔎 Debugging Walkthrough

Let’s walk through both test cases to explain how the code works step by step.

### Test Case 1:

**Input:** `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]`, `nums2 = [2, 2]`

1. **Frequency Array for nums1:** After processing `nums1`, the frequency array `freq` will look like this:

   ```
   freq[1] = 2
   freq[2] = 2
   ```

2. **Process nums2:**
   - First `2` in `nums2`: Since `freq[2] > 0`, add `2` to the result and decrease `freq[2]` to `1`.
   - Second `2` in `nums2`: Since `freq[2] > 0`, add `2` to the result and decrease `freq[2]` to `0`.

**Output:** `[2, 2]`

### Test Case 2:

**Input:** `nums1 = [4, 9, 5]`, `nums2 = [9, 4, 9, 8, 4]`

1. **Frequency Array for nums1:** After processing `nums1`, the frequency array `freq` will look like this:

   ```
   freq[4] = 1
   freq[9] = 1
   freq[5] = 1
   ```

2. **Process nums2:**
   - First `9`: Since `freq[9] > 0`, add `9` to the result and decrease `freq[9]` to `0`.
   - First `4`: Since `freq[4] > 0`, add `4` to the result and decrease `freq[4]` to `0`.
   - The remaining numbers (`9`, `8`, `4`) are either duplicates or not present in `nums1`, so they are skipped.

**Output:** `[9, 4]` (or `[4, 9]`)

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n + m):** We traverse `nums1` once to build the frequency array and `nums2` once to build the result. Thus, the time complexity is linear with respect to the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(1):** The size of the frequency array (`freq`) is fixed at 1001 elements, so the space complexity is constant, independent of the input size.
