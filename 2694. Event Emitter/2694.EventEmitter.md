## Solution in javascript

```js
class EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    this.events = new Map(); // Initialize the map to store event names and their associated callback functions
  }

  subscribe(eventName, callback) {
    if (!this.events.has(eventName)) {
      this.events.set(eventName, []); // If the event does not exist, initialize it with an empty array
    }
    const listeners = this.events.get(eventName); // Get the array of callbacks associated with the event
    listeners.push(callback); // Add the new callback to the array

    return {
      unsubscribe: () => {
        const index = listeners.indexOf(callback); // Find the index of the callback to unsubscribe
        if (index !== -1) {
          listeners.splice(index, 1); // Remove the callback from the array if found
        }
      },
    };
  }

  emit(eventName, args = []) {
    const listeners = this.events.get(eventName) || []; // Get the array of callbacks for the event, or an empty array if none exist
    return listeners.map((callback) => callback(...args)); // Call each callback with the provided arguments and return an array of their results
  }
}
```

## Explanation

### Objective of the Exercise:

The exercise's goal is to create an `EventEmitter` class that allows for event-driven programming by enabling the subscription to and emission of events. This class should allow multiple callbacks (listeners) to be associated with a specific event, and when that event is emitted, all associated callbacks should be called in the order they were subscribed.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Class Initialization with a Map:**
   - The `EventEmitter` class starts with a constructor that initializes a `Map` named `events`. This `Map` will store event names as keys and arrays of callback functions as values.
   - A `Map` is used here instead of a regular object because `Map` provides more reliable and consistent performance, particularly when handling a dynamic set of keys (event names) and values (arrays of callbacks).
2. **Subscribing to Events:**
   - The `subscribe` method allows you to associate a callback function with a specific event name.
   - If the event name does not already exist in the `events` map, the method initializes an empty array for it. This array will hold all the callbacks (listeners) for that event.
   - The provided callback function is then added to the array of listeners for the event.
3. **Returning an Unsubscribe Function:**
   - The `subscribe` method returns an object containing an `unsubscribe` method. This method allows the caller to remove the specific callback from the list of listeners.
   - The `unsubscribe` method works by finding the index of the callback within the listeners' array and removing it using the `splice` method. If the callback is found, it is removed, ensuring that it will no longer be called when the event is emitted.
4. **Emitting Events:**
   - The `emit` method is responsible for triggering the callbacks associated with a specific event.
   - It takes the event name and an optional array of arguments (`args`) that will be passed to each callback.
   - The method retrieves the array of listeners for the specified event. If no listeners are found (i.e., the event doesn't exist), it defaults to an empty array.
   - It then calls each callback in the array with the provided arguments and returns an array of the results from each callback invocation. This ensures that all listeners are executed in the order they were added.
5. **JavaScript Concepts Behind the Code:**
   - **Map:** A `Map` is a key-value data structure in JavaScript that allows for the storage of unique keys mapped to values. In this case, the keys are event names (strings), and the values are arrays of callbacks (functions).
   - **Callback Functions:** Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are meant to be executed later, usually in response to an event. In this `EventEmitter` implementation, callbacks are associated with event names and are executed when the corresponding event is emitted.
   - **Splice:** The `splice` method is used to remove a specific element from an array. In the `unsubscribe` method, `splice` removes the callback from the array of listeners, ensuring that the event no longer triggers that specific callback.
   - **Handling Missing Events:** By using `|| []` in the `emit` method, the code ensures that even if no listeners are found for an event, the method can still safely execute and return an empty array.
